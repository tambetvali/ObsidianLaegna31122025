# Ponegative analysis

While in binary, we have these operations:

- Negative links to negation and negotion
    - It’s real axe is negotion
    - It’s projective axe is negation
- Positive links to position and posetion
    - It’s real axe is position
    - It’s projective axe is posetion
- It has, thus, the real and projective compound axes of two dimensions (for example, averaged or with unbound / separate free variables by assigning digits with discrete values averaging to their correct order or positions, but rather keeping together digits from the same series so that exact order is partially lost, which is resolved by XYZ fractal of Mathematecs or helping it with logex system analysis by Logecs, which would do discrete math combining the numbers like logical systems, then resonate the mathematecal solution in virtual machine for the math, resembling a continuous system):
    - Real axe: Here, the local values are not cancelled in long term.
    - Projective axe: here we are paranoid or falling into gold rush or sensationalism.

For creating Binary Logex, logical part of it’s machine, we need to project this into binary bits and program the result in rather linear format of decimal system orientation, following it’s Latin roots. Virtual machine is controlling each such complex, “Tin” to resemble “binary ten” vs. “tenary ten” (where “ten” is real part, “tene” is complex part, and “tenet” from estonian network of roads is complex number with it’s complex and rather non-linear dimension where, for example, you could project logical fallacies into numbers given that each broken chain of logic leads to corrupt axe, where linear real part and exponential complex part are not equal, thus the dimensionality easily follows the complex plane; as with mathematical loans, you can pay for errors and change context to restore the order in Nature, it’s possibility, also errors are rather gradial than black and white - from some higher perspective, ours could be rather error if their own strict criteria is mapped to ours, assuming it’s not Posetive or a Rosedriad.

**Degenerative force of Logecs in relation to accelerating speed of neutral zero**: using theorem of Polarity in kybalion, we reverse it to future and get: it’s always getting better, even if the good does not win always in advance, but is rather stabilizing into better order like a pendulum, which always finds higher degree of order and thus, lack of it from that perspective - and in ideal mathematical coordinate system it would appear the pendulum does not stop, nor change it’s accelerative speed given the mistake is part of harmony as stated in Law of Imperfection, that any law is true given that it fluctuates through Truth in such a manner to apply cone, sine and cosine, harmonize deductive Z with combinatoric X (using existing axioms, theorems and conjectures) and inductive Y, which resonates and accelerates into the future.

**Theorem itself**: unless you keep constant acceleration towards having not a real number value of time, but rather their limit beyond any actual value, including the imaginary limit of it’s continuation, 48 or IE vs. ie is the axe, where mapping the real and not complex number indeed having complex as back-up for 48, which is basically ÍÓ, not IO frequency; but given the theorem of Laegna numbers that we fill the same frequencies and values of each dimension with what we already have, to keep the limit of the number converging and the number space not getting lost into surreal number space of impossible numbers, not touching themselves in infinity for example the Latin Oog number system is smaller than itself as an R unit of it’s possible values, since in infinity each number, in accelerating pace, becomes smaller than itself projecting a false value to be interpreted wrongly, and accounting by this value to create the difference in real and projective space in directions of Posetive and Negotive, values of R=O of Logex. 48 is statically representing it’s maximum values on this linear axe with basis 14, numbers from 1 to 4 - while the lower limit of 48 basically equals to higher limit of 14, so both of them contain each others as U or V values, the contained infinitesimal is so small that we won’t see it basically, but preserving the number map. This comes from angular properties of the number, which are defined symmetric. 4 + U or 5 - U would lead to the actual zenter, where we can zoom into this U (normalized scale refers to two zeroes unless you stretch the number into wider form, where value of R would become higher to change the coordinate system and value of r would become higher by same multiplier to change the point size accordingly and thus keep the number of values inside the variable type, guaranteeing another, but equal and coordinated dimension or dimensional frequency, a digit on higher line of multiline number). Now, 5 + U or 6 - U would keep you neutral in terms of infinity, but once you have those digits at all, while they keep static rather containing your true name and the wovs than any temporary qualities - thus, your identity or personality is multiplier of mostly 48 digits, or you could say your genes except the randomly mutating part or factor must be so; while they keep still, your number space is growing towards them. Normally, values are 14 values, but functions are defined as 48 as whatever you do with values, the function itself will keep it’s static appearance and factors and always show the new value in the same scope of it’s symmetries and ponegative relations.

**Theorem original**: unless you keep accelerating into infinity, combining 3 and 7 as position and roposition for example in the polar system of 48 being real (the simplest laegna decimal system, where 0 is U, 9 is V, 14 is range of ie and 48 is range of IE; while the standard definition is 14 in range of IE and 48 in range of ÓR, it’s more complex rather “ideal” state of affairs, simply because real is not defined with *properties* of imaginary axe, but in decimal it *simplifies* it and *contains* each possible value from 1 to 4, from I to E, which appear on both left and top in definition of complex number, associating each complex number with it’s real counterpart, with it’s *meaning* of being a *complex number* remains by having the definition of *decimal ideal of Laegna complex*).

Why I have each number system?

- Real numbers IE are simple format for basic infinities, tens.
- Real and complex counterparts IErÓR (r being the connection, “R” as operator being space operator to connect the spaces for example) as separate axes or within RT definition of even and odd digits in RT-discriminating or R-considering numbers; this still, by each real number digit, complies perfectly to it’s real number representation. This is ten+tene.
- Complex number itself, consisting of 16 values in two dimensions - here, counterparts O and Ó cannot be separated directly. This is tenet, network of roads (tee in estonian) or of the life force or position, theorem before or following, potentially or after normalization implying reaching infinity, where each probable numberic interpretation must fit it’s contextual interpretation, and for each number the relative context is different so they do not create paradox more than a reality, which is parallel to that concept (we read Laegna words through, where they flow through logic, so they can be parallel unlike binary which we idealize into metastasis and then view from it’s side, or top if it’s on table or flat floor), would do.
- Decimal 09 system is the linear representation of complex and real digits separated.
- OA numbers give binary or den counterparts.

Ponegative: following the Ponegate (ponegator) logecs with your reasoning in such way that it’s rather integral and kind of “invisible” in sense that your system does not need additional operations nor fall into any binary trap, which would appear.

# The Sanity Paradox

<aside>
💡

The Sanity Paradox: while you can be mad or normal based on your own value or expression for situation, or stage of development (T) in static logical space; Logex would also interpret if the context system (R) is shifting and because T = R, while the relative number is shifting, the absolute number T would shift the same amount into the same direction to remain in a position without loan; while it’s logical space or acceleration system / inertial system is shifting north, each number contained is shifting north in a degree of being static and having fixed position in regards to inner coordinates of inertial system. This effect is explicitly called Roponegate / roposition or Rosedriad, while without 48 values one could use normal posetion as soon as the value becomes visible, but not giving effort to the “Mind” of those numbers or rather their active context systems, which would have dimensions of the same digits where they resonate to suboctave from ÍÓ position, or when they evolve into their actual solutions and releases of oscillating tensions from the lower, IO counterpart - in each case, frequency in actual material world, locally measurable angles or AE span would appear (where *A* is countable numbers, and *E* is countable in regards to infinity, with balanced information load to cover the finite and infinite in stable, balanced order where the Zen and Tao would be followed; Tao is how infinity and finity values interact, fighting for the same digit).

💡

ÍÓ and IO space digits are in separate dimensions, but symmetrical - the value is *even*, which would see changes of each in measurable units regards to the other; so the base value would contain another as R, the context, and have R = T - in context of lower IO frequencies, when you have some number and do not have the higher frequency otherwise than repetition of this number, it’s neutralized by the higher frequency of it.

AE numbers do not interact - they don’t have the Pythagorean harmonics of two simple even relations (where even and odd are rather relations than numeric values, in case of R changing rather than regarding to zero and one as centers of velocity and acceleration, with two being the suboctave projection of what is infinity in superoctave 1 step above it in full octaves - of logic, because size of octave depends on units and wideness of number system or axe, or rather the number class or type); AE numbers are *odd*, which means their frequential zone consists of irrational numbers and you definitely need them as separate numbers, rather disctinct personality of time vs. space, or Laegna mascots Elise and Daisy being in different worlds and playfully fighting, having the constant activity of cats of either playfully fighting, enjoying each others presence, or doing those two simultaneously at the same time.

**Degenerative force of Logecs in relation to accelerating speed of neutral zero**: for each Logecs space there exists a higher space, into which it maps as ordinary binary logic, but with additional qualities such as not disturbing much with it’s lower level of ideas vs. lower frequency of systematically imposing authority, becoming posetive and leveraging negotive. The story of each 56-logecal story or line would provoke questions about how to combine the help for them along with some rejection of their ideas.

**IO ogi / oog / oig**: The zone of destructive degenerades is time IO of history, before the Middle of Time (symbolic or archetypical image of where Laegna starts - be it psychological in your own space, or be there some breakthrough where Laegna is approved; or where one finds the solid infinity-space and thus passes the zero where number parts are not in fractal distance as in ice, but in conjugation as in unity and - potential for - freedom).

**UV**: you can include UV digits to mark down your doubts, but remember the normalized number must be *statistical* to not remove the UV digits by transformation of coordinate system and the values into space, which is known, by operational genius of philosophical doubt (in classical Physics, such as Maxwell - in Laegna system for numbers and relations, already there are some methods such as Laegna philosophy and integral development or unity of opposites, the Tao or Taúponégate for letting go of the known values and letting them to leave free their oppositions into Retaphysical change, where Reta would be dynamic Meta, which does not exist in static time of logic, but in the dynamic point time of Logecs, which still relates in cause and effect and order of calculations inside, even in unknown kind of dimensional relations of unknown dimensions - where it would fractally repeat it’s digits unless they are defined into separate entity; for example as long as you use AE numbers, this is the full number scale, but if you use ae and AE, it’s broken into smaller and bigger dimension as if AE where R=AE contains extreme coordinates of both coordinates, a vs. E where both axes in ierIE would *componentize* it rather than *extend*, unless you extend it with r and R multipliers such as r, R = r * 2, R * 2 *using the Python simplification for notation of combined expressions*).

**AE age / aal / aeg**: The zone of common cityzens would be creative through their unique experience and personality, providing into *entropy* of trying different values on different simplification level; they would be born into this frequency or evolutionary phase sufficiently often, or such forms created by socionics of evolution and it’s optimizations for random factors of genes to create distributions - with smaller rate, but elevated acceleration competence or passing the accelerated times as they need specific operation for each part of acceleration; while the civilization accelerates, the rhythyms to eat, sleep and talk do not lose their vibration rates of your dayrhythym, but rather the quality improves - still, the original seeds on lower vibrations, where each complex theory gets simplified, rather resembles lower rate in terms of inspiration and visibility perhaps (I want to leave a Tao paradox here, because the dimensions of measure are multiple and thus they live in same reality, but with multiplicity of reasons for their survival, birth and existence). It’s politically incorrect, thus, to say *degenerade*, because they would need to *control the better* and *false project themselves*, to have this effect, coming from Posetive rather than Position.

# Problem of this story

While the *youth* and *ever-young* are passed a *generation*, stepping the evolution with *acceleration effect as it’s result*, there is rather linear counterpart of old generation, which for whicever reason rather wants to keep it’s relative position for example like 50% of authority and 75% of money of the city, where others have money in other cities but visiting here - still, the relation now is rather *absolute*, where the old would keep all their business and target to comply with new standards with instructor help, but rather it’s *shamed* to get outdates. Getting multiple posetives, even considering negotives as being fairly equal in case of the worst dream of them being still really useless even for base reality not the “winners” now hated for the relative shadow they leave to others, who have been progressihg very well considering the past acceleration, as seen from then.
