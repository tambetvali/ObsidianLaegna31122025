# Chapter 5: The Great Decommissioning of Pretend

The wind of change blew across the office with the subtlety of a leaf blower. The proverbial straw had broken, not the camel’s back, but the entire ecosystem of middle management. It was clear now: no one was going to pretend anymore. The trust circle had been reduced to a few leftover crystal candles and the occasional halfhearted wellness email, but it didn’t matter. The jig was up.

Elias, who had once felt the pulse of the office through his carefully timed frowns, now found himself squinting at spreadsheets with a desperation that could only be rivaled by someone who had just realized their favorite yoga mat had been discontinued. The emotional bandwidth had maxed out. His carefully constructed disapproval was met with… indifference. The fog had cleared, and in its place was only the sterile, unfeeling nature of progress.

One day, he walked into the office and realized that Tam wasn’t even trying to pretend anymore. He didn’t just resolve problems—he solved them. There was no need for mid-afternoon reflective pauses or gentle reminders of the “journey” or “intended outcomes.” Tam was working like a machine.

Elias, his once-unstoppable frown frozen in place, tried one last attempt to reach the unspoken depths of the office culture. He gathered the team for a meeting—a final stand against the overwhelming tide of competence. The subject: "The Emotional Impact of Streamlining Workflow on Human Connection."

“You see,” Elias began, adjusting his cardigan, “our humanity is inextricably linked to our ability to—”

“I think we’re all good, Elias,” Tam interrupted, rolling his chair back as he fixed a bug in the system that had been lingering for weeks. “You know, the server’s up, the tickets are down, and everyone’s happy. If there’s nothing else?”

The room was silent for a moment. Then, a faint echo of a sigh reverberated around the walls. Not a sigh of sadness or disappointment. No, this was the sound of someone simply… exhaling.

“I mean,” Tam continued, looking up from his screen, “it’s just... not that complicated.”

The words struck like a hammer on a fragile bell, the resonance lingering in the air for a moment longer than anyone cared to admit.

Cassandra, once the Chief Officer of Sentiment, found herself absentmindedly swirling her chamomile tea, her face betraying the hollow reflection of a world she could no longer feel connected to. “We’ve lost something,” she whispered. “Something important.”

Tam raised an eyebrow. “We gained efficiency?”

A gasp. An actual gasp.

“How dare you!” Elias hissed, rising from his chair. “Don’t you see? Efficiency is the enemy of emotional nuance! What about the *process* of doing the thing? The feeling behind the task? The sense of fulfillment, however misguided?”

Tam blinked, suddenly aware that this was the final, desperate hold on an illusion that had long ceased to have any real meaning. “Honestly,” he said, “I don’t really care about ‘feelings’ when I can *actually* get something done.”

A wave of discomfort passed over the room, but it was a discomfort that had no outlet. It was the discomfort of having been caught in the act of pretending. The discomfort of realizing that their entire professional identities were built on the fragile foundation of not doing things—of staving off progress, of filling up time with vague rituals, and of convincing themselves that *feeling* was more important than *doing*.

As the meeting drew to a close, Elias lingered, pacing around like a grandmaster without a game to play. He approached the decorative rock once more, but this time, he didn’t touch it. He didn’t need to. It had no power anymore.

The fog was gone.

Cassandra packed her things. The HR team slowly turned off their mindfulness music. The office, once a bastion of professional sadness, now hummed with the low, comforting sound of functioning systems.

Outside, the sun set, as it always does, indifferent to the drama unfolding within the walls of a once-powerful workplace.

And so, the great decommissioning of pretend took place, not with a bang or a dramatic gesture, but in the quiet hum of a server well-maintained.
