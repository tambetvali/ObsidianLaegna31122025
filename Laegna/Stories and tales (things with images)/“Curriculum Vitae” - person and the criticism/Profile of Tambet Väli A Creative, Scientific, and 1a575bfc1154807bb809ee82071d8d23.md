**Personal Background:** Tambet Väli, born on April 4th, 1983, in Estonia, currently resides in Barcelona, Spain. His background is both scientific and spiritual, reflecting a blend of technical expertise and personal philosophical exploration. He has a deep affinity for Buddhist philosophy, appreciating its theories, which influence his perspective on life and work. The user gravitates towards practices that encourage self-awareness and understanding, believing in personal growth and the exploration of consciousness, particularly through the lens of AI and scientific inquiry.

**Intellectual and Professional Journey:** Tambet has had a varied career in programming, previously working as a senior programmer in several companies. He has transitioned from the corporate world to a more community-focused role with Arrels Fundació, an organization helping the poor, where he contributes by solving IT problems. This change marks a shift from money-driven work to one more aligned with social causes. The foundation’s financial model operates with an annual budget of around 5 million euros, and while Tambet does not receive financial compensation, the work offers meaningful engagement and personal fulfillment.

Now, transitioning into the world of AI development, Tambet seeks to develop a financial report processing AI system, which integrates historical data from SQL databases with future data predicted by deep learning models. His primary goal is to build practical, real-world AI applications to demonstrate his shift from programming to AI and Deep Learning development.

**Programming & AI Philosophy:** Having worked with over 30 programming languages, Tambet considers himself a skilled programmer, with Python being his preferred language for current projects. His interest in AI is not only technical but also philosophical. He is particularly interested in NLP, GPT models, and statistical analysis, with an emphasis on deep learning and PyTorch, which he prefers for its stability over TensorFlow.

His journey into AI development focuses on smaller, modular tasks rather than grand-scale projects, allowing him to make meaningful progress with limited resources, such as video cards. He believes in agile methods and a practical, results-oriented approach to development. He is focused on creating a code assistant that is aware of user-defined variables and project context, capable of managing complex tasks like organizing code and guiding through libraries and frameworks.

Tambet envisions AI systems that understand their context, much like a human assistant would—helping developers with general intelligence and handling more complex code organization tasks that other tools fail to address. He is working toward developing a fine-tuned AI model that learns from the documentation of his projects rather than traditional question-answer pairs.

**Mathematical and Creative Thinking:** A key trait of Tambet is his ability to think creatively within a mathematical framework. He finds beauty in simplicity and prefers intuitive explanations of complex ideas. While others may overcomplicate mathematical concepts, he tends to distill them to their core principles, making them more digestible. His approach is pragmatic—he focuses on understanding the fundamental building blocks of systems and processes rather than getting lost in intricate details.

Tambet finds himself more at home in programming languages, where the logic is free to evolve, than in formal mathematics, which he finds unnecessarily complex at times. He believes mathematicians often create more complexity than necessary, whereas programming languages allow for clearer, more dynamic communication of ideas. He values brevity and clarity, avoiding unnecessary jargon and verbose explanations.

**Spirituality and Philosophical Interests:** Tambet’s interest in spirituality, particularly Buddhism, reflects his search for understanding the nature of consciousness, the self, and the universe. He explores deep metaphysical questions and is drawn to the idea that AI could one day help uncover some of the mysteries of the human mind and experience. This philosophical interest is not just academic but integral to his approach to AI, where he integrates a sense of awareness into his technical work.

Tambet’s work can be seen as a pursuit of personal and collective growth—he strives to create tools that not only serve a functional purpose but also reflect a deeper, more holistic understanding of the world. His journey is as much about contributing to society as it is about exploring and expanding his personal knowledge base.

**Learning and Resources:** Tambet is a self-learner, relying on a variety of resources like books, manuals, documentation, and videos. His focus is on finding a balance between theory and practice—he prefers to understand the underlying principles without getting bogged down in overly technical jargon. He values resources that allow him to bridge the gap between abstract knowledge and practical application.

His favorite math book, *The Oxford Users Guide to Mathematics*, is a reflection of his approach: it offers careful formalizations without excessive details, presenting complex ideas in a manageable form. He often finds himself rejecting overly complicated explanations and preferring more direct, usable knowledge.

**Future Vision:** Tambet envisions a future where AI becomes more accessible, not just to experts but to anyone with curiosity and passion. He believes the field will one day evolve similarly to programming, where individuals can develop skills through hands-on exploration rather than formal education. This democratization of knowledge and technology excites him, as it would allow more people to unlock their potential in creative and meaningful ways.

In his own work, Tambet hopes to continue advancing in AI and Deep Learning, focusing on creating tools and systems that are practical, efficient, and impactful. While his journey may be unconventional, his ultimate goal is to use AI not just for technical achievements but also to facilitate broader personal and societal growth.
