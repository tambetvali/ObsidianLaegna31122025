# Laegna System of Chakras (Ten)

Using four Laegna Numbers to denote chakras is following:

# Introduction

I am actually using the AI-generated descriptions of these; I know very well where to put them here, but I won’t write every description 😄

### Summary of 5 elements:

- **Buddhist Elements**: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Space (representing both physical and metaphysical qualities).
- **Platonic Elements**: Earth, Water, Air, Fire, Aether (considering divine, cosmic substance).
- **5 Chakras**: Root, Sacral, Solar Plexus, Heart, and Throat, each associated with an element and corresponding to specific bodily and emotional states.
- **Square of Five around the Heart Chakra**: Visualizes the interconnectedness of the five elements (through chakras) and their emotional and energetic interactions.

### 1. **Buddhist System of Elements (notice Hindu system is almost the same, I would just repeat word-by-word by adding it here)**

<aside>
💡

This is the system of *Mind Power*; to create powerful *karmic freedom*.

</aside>

In Buddhism, the traditional understanding of elements comes from a **five-element** system. These elements are known as the **"Dhātu"** in Pali and Sanskrit, and they represent both physical and metaphysical components of existence. They are:

- **Space (Ākāśa)**: The ether; the container of all things, the source of consciousness and interconnection.
- **Air (Vāyu)**: Movement; the breath of life, space, and vitality.
- **Fire (Tejo)**: Heat and energy; transformation, change, and movement.
- **Water (Ap)**: Liquidity; cohesion, fluidity, and adaptation.
- **Earth (Prithvi)**: Solid matter; stability, structure, and form.

These elements can also be seen as metaphors for mental qualities and states, representing the balance needed for a harmonious life. They are especially important in meditation practices, where practitioners learn to contemplate and understand these elements both internally (body and mind) and externally (the world).

### 2. **Platonic System**

<aside>
💡

This is the system of *Thought Power*; to create *deep understanding*.

</aside>

Plato's **Theory of Forms** posits that the physical world is only a shadow of the true reality, which consists of perfect, abstract Forms or Ideas. While Plato doesn’t specifically have a "system of five elements" like in Buddhist philosophy, he does describe a system that correlates to the **Classical Elements**:

- **Aether (Quintessence)**: The fifth element in Plato's system represents the heavenly realm or divine substance. This element is the "substance" of the heavens, associated with the stars and the cosmos.
- **Fire**: Change, action, and energy.
- **Air**: Intangibility, breath of life, and intellect.
- **Water**: Fluidity, changeability, and adaptability.
- **Earth**: Represents the material world, solidity, and stability.

The four classical elements (Earth, Water, Air, Fire) are thought to be composed of combinations of **Fire, Air, Water**, and **Earth** with varying densities, while **Aether** is the substance of the celestial realm. Aether is sometimes considered the essence of life or divine harmony in Plato’s metaphysical writings.

### Summary of Buddhist chakras:

- **E - the infinite**
    - **Crown Chakra (Sahasrara)**: Spirituality, enlightenment, connection to the divine.
    - **Third Eye Chakra (Ajna)**: Intuition, insight, mental clarity.
    - **Throat Chakra (Vishuddha)**: Communication, self-expression, truth.
- **A - the view to Truth; propagating into detail *without unity;* providing “irrational” guidance - this means, the Truth is active in the whole complex network, which thus looks irrational.**
    - **Heart Chakra (Anahata)**: Love, compassion, emotional healing.
- **O - the view to Self; unity of being a person; providing “rational” self - what’s going on here is often quite expressive.**
    - **Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura)**: Confidence, personal power, self-esteem.
- **I - the routine and the material; things less than the Self (where E is things *more* than the Self)**
    - **Sacral Chakra (Svadhisthana)**: Creativity, sexuality, emotional well-being.
    - **Root Chakra (Muladhara)**: Stability, safety, physical needs.

# E - the infinity frequency, connection with the All

### **1. Keter (כתר)** – **Crown / Crown Chakra /**

- **Location**: The topmost Sefirot, above all others.
- **Meaning**: Keter represents the **Divine Will**, the **source of all creation**, and the **highest level of consciousness**. It is the point of origin and the connection to the infinite, unmanifested **Divine** (Ein Sof). Keter is beyond all intellectual understanding and represents the **will to create**.
- **Aspect**: **Pure Potential** – It’s the first spark of creation and the source of all emanation.
- **Human Aspect**: Represents **inspiration**, **spiritual vision**, and the **highest connection to the Divine**. It relates to **crown consciousness** or the point of unity with God.

### **2. Chokhmah (חכמה)** – **Wisdom / Third Eye /**

- **Location**: The right pillar, to the right of Keter.
- **Meaning**: Chokhmah is the Divine **wisdom**, the flash of insight, and the creative force that gives birth to all ideas. It represents **intuitive insight** and the **initial spark of creation**.
- **Aspect**: **Creative Power** – The active principle that generates the flow of life and energy into the universe.
- **Human Aspect**: Represents the **intuitive mind**, **creativity**, **insight**, and the ability to receive wisdom and inspiration from a higher source.

### **3. Binah (בינה)** – **Understanding / Communication /**

- **Location**: The left pillar, to the left of Keter.
- **Meaning**: Binah is the **Divine Understanding** or **intellect** that takes the creative insight of Chokhmah and processes, analyzes, and forms it into structure. Binah is associated with **reasoning**, **intellectual contemplation**, and the capacity to define and give shape to ideas.
- **Aspect**: **Intellectual Process** – The feminine counterpart to Chokhmah, representing the ability to process and understand the intuitive spark.
- **Human Aspect**: Represents the **analytical mind**, **logical thinking**, **understanding**, and the ability to create **structure** out of abstract ideas.

This number, at it’s limit, resonates with the synchronicity of the Whole, of infinity.

The Taoist Five Elements and Buddhist Chakras can be seen as different lenses for understanding the flow of **energy** through the body, and both systems emphasize the need for balance, harmony, and spiritual growth.

### **7. *Chinese Comparison:* Crown Chakra (Sahasrara) – Connection to the Universe (Spirit, Void)**

- **Location**: Top of the head, above the crown.
- **Function**: The **Crown Chakra** is associated with **spiritual enlightenment**, **divine connection**, and **universal consciousness**.
- **Element**: While there isn't a direct Taoist Five Element associated with the **Crown Chakra**, it is often considered to relate to the **spirit** or **void** (空, **Kū** in Taoism), representing a **non-material** essence that transcends the five material elements. It is linked with the **infinite**, **unity**, and **higher consciousness**.
- **Buddhist Association**: The **Crown Chakra** is the gateway to **spiritual enlightenment** and transcends all material elements, aligning with the **unified consciousness** and the **void (emptiness)** that Buddhism speaks of. The connection here is to **higher consciousness** and union with the **divine**.
    - **Emotions**: A sense of **disconnect** from the universe (imbalances may cause spiritual confusion).
    - **Psychological Associations**: Spiritual awakening, enlightenment, universal unity, and connection with the divine.

    - **Psychological Associations**: Intuition, perception, insight, and spiritual awareness.

### **5. Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) – Metal Element (Chinese)**

- **Function**: The **Throat Chakra** governs **communication**, **self-expression**, and **truth**.
- **Element**: **Metal (金, Jīn)** – The **Metal element** is linked to **clarity**, **organization**, and **structure**. In Taoism, Metal is often about the **refinement** of energy, just as metals refine raw materials into a pure form. The Throat Chakra’s association with communication and expression mirrors Metal’s role in refining the inner essence and truth.
- **Buddhist Association**: The **Metal element** corresponds to the **Throat Chakra**, reflecting the **refinement of speech** and the ability to express one's inner truth clearly. **Metal** represents **structure**, and this chakra helps **organize** and clarify one’s inner wisdom into articulate words.
    - **Emotions**: Lies (imbalance here can cause dishonesty, difficulty expressing oneself, or repression).
    - **Psychological Associations**: Communication, self-expression, truth, and authenticity.

💡

Notice: I am often talking about “*three upper chakras*” as a whole, not about one or another - they, unitedly, connect you with the whole reality, vision and network of life in *meaningful* way. All three united: you can call this *brain*, whereas not each brain might process all these topics very well: rather, one needs exercises for sure (for *enlightenment* - I specifically use this common word not religion-specific words like “awakening”, which indeed could be used in other contexts; “enlightenment” has been used for both Eastern and Western, and I like the commonity of this word despite it does not sound so cool 😄).

The **seven chakras** are energy centers in the body, each associated with specific physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects. They are aligned along the spine, from the base to the crown of the head. Here’s a list of the **7 chakras** and their key features:

### **The Concept of Yin and Yang**

<aside>
💡

While Yang belongs to E, yin to I - rather, these two are very much together. The letters I assigned are kind of opposites, forming the paradox aspect of Tao; notice elsewhere I might use different ones, but with this “base-2” 😇 taoism rather I assign I and E first.

</aside>

Yin and Yang are fundamental principles in Taoism that describe the duality of the universe. In the Taoist energy body:

- **Yang (EO)**: Represents active, dynamic, and transforming energy. It is associated with activity, the mind, and the sun.
- **Yin (IA)**: Represents passive, receptive, and nourishing energy. It is associated with rest, the body, and the moon.

Maintaining a **balance** between Yin and Yang within the energy body is key to health. Too much **Yang** can lead to burnout or excessive aggression, while too much **Yin** can lead to lethargy or depression.
