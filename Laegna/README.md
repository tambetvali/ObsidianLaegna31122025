# 🌿 Laegna — Knowledge Vault

This repository contains the **Laegna knowledge vault**, a collection of interconnected writings, conceptual notes, and supporting materials centered around the main document:

👉 **[Laegna 1a575bfc115480a38129e9a9787ab565.md](./Laegna%201a575bfc115480a38129e9a9787ab565.md)**

This root file is the **core text** of the Laegna system.  
It introduces the ideas, themes, and conceptual foundations that the rest of the vault expands upon.

## 📘 The Laegna Text

The main Laegna document presents a unified body of thought exploring:

- the structure of meaning  
- the development of inner and outer systems  
- conceptual resonance and coherence  
- the relationship between perception, mathematics, and lived experience  
- the unfolding of ideas through layered, interconnected notes  

It is written as a continuous text, but it naturally branches into smaller conceptual units.  
Those branches appear in the `/Laegna` folder.

## 🌱 The Laegna Vault

The folder:

👉 **[`/Laegna`](./Laegna/)**

contains the **expanded universe** of the main document — the notes, definitions, clarifications, and conceptual side‑paths that originally appeared in the Notion side pane.

These files correspond to:

- sub‑chapters  
- elaborations of key ideas  
- supporting reflections  
- conceptual nodes referenced by the main text  

Together, they form a **navigable knowledge tree**, allowing the reader to move between the central narrative and its deeper layers.

## 🧭 How to Read the Vault

1. **Begin with the main Laegna document**  
   It provides the orientation and conceptual grounding.

2. **Follow its references into the `/Laegna` folder**  
   Each linked note expands a specific idea or opens a new conceptual branch.

3. **Explore freely**  
   The vault is designed for non‑linear reading.  
   Notes connect through meaning rather than strict hierarchy.

4. **Use any Markdown‑friendly environment**  
   GitHub, Obsidian, VS Code, or any plain‑text reader will work.

## 🌐 Context

The Laegna material originates from a larger conceptual environment and has been adapted into this Markdown vault so it can be:

- read  
- studied  
- extended  
- reorganized  
- explored as a living body of knowledge  

The structure mirrors the original Notion workspace, where the main document was accompanied by a side‑pane of related notes — now represented by the `/Laegna` folder.
