# Collective Human Ponegate

These texts represent the evolution of *Posetion* and *Rosedriad*, in context of large groups.

It would resemble stories of Christ of Socrates, also giving hints that these pure principles or archetypes are constantly noticeable even in many aspects of modern society, slowing down things and providing us with “soft death”, where the social and financial bonds or even physical well-being would get insulted and need heavy work.

### Understanding posetive-negotive complexes in society

While we talk about archetypes of the collective life, not only “*positive*” (position or posetion) and “*negative*” (negation or negotion) binary values should be considered, but rather we can analyze these stories about the sign - several articles here are about this.

***The Sanity Paradox: A Tale of Power, Reality, and Law*** - here, negotion and posetion, along with position and negation, are considered in complex cycles of changes, either T or R.

***The Journey of the Mind: Transcendence, Balance, and the Path to Constructive Transformation***

***The Invisible Forces of Power: A Dualistic Dance of Cooperation and Conspiracy***

***Article Title: The Dangers of Democracy without True Representation: A Critique of the Worst 1% and Their Motives*** - if you belong to 49% perhaps where “fools want power”!

***The Struggle for Identity, Power, and Society: A Personal and Philosophical Reflection***

### Innovation

***Navigating Complex Situations in Tech Projects: The Journey of Legality, Motivation, and Overcoming Challenges***
