# Circularity of Logex

Remember, a number can be smaller or bigger than itself.

{

 commands

}

Here, commands would run into cycle - where it ends, it begins again with new values.

If, through OA cycles of linear space and IE cycles of subblocks, which keep their past and future, for example the variable a is added 1 each time, it’s not a problem but instead, utilizing infinity dimensions, it becomes an *accelerated* value.

Such values actually do not become *so* disturbed in space of Halting Problems and other such things.

Ideally, the halting problem:

{

  if (!halt) halt;

  halt = false;

  if (halt) loop(inf);

  halt = true;

}

This won’t run into any paradox in it’s structure, as what we are interested is the actual halt, otherwise we would stop. While the paradox is still there, it’s not exactly in our task - in case the computer would analyze this one properly, the solution would be proper.

It would run one cycle without value of “halt”, without standing long in the sub-loops or higher optimization layers; rather it would do with the constants.
