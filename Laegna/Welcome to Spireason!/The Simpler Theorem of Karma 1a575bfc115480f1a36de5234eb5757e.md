# The Simpler Theorem of Karma

**The Simpler Theorem of Karma**

**How this Theorem Holds**

It holds in two ways, which are of different philosophical strength. Philosophical strength follows all factors – for example, in Science and Philosophy, the direction of Thought bound to doubt, the most important factor is doubting again, getting a fresh wind of philosophical doubt. I call this Factor I (the smallest number in my Mathematics), getting the energy from Negotion – you already know things, but you still get another shield of doubt you have gone through – giving a new doubt, for example for Theory of Reincarnation or even the Faith itself, it destroys our world and brings a Negative Magic into our life – those Negotions have an effect on our Reality. When we cannot tolerate them, they destroy us, but as we get stronger, our Negation and Position strength (O and A, as in Alpha and Omega of Truth) become Stronger, and they start conquering the World of Too Bad and Too Good – I use the letters I and E, Negotion and Posetion. Philosophical doubt brings us to letter I – it does not offer give us nothing, and in extreme, we only gather idea of “we think and feel, therefore something exists (Bertrand Russell, Descartes and some old philosophies carry this as the very basic); going deeper, we can achieve some doubt even in that idea itself. Healthy

considerations, like Other People Exist, The World Exists, or even God Exists – they are further and further away from this seed we can reach by Negativity, by exploring the deeper areas of deeper doubt; doubt always have a Reason – and once going through this, we become Stronger. Catholic monks, for example, were taught to Doubt in Existence of God, to understand their Proofs and Experiences better and gain a Victory over this kind of “Demonic Thought” (it becomes Demonic to believe that God does not exist in Any Form Whatsoever – even Evolution, as a Principle, is kind of God Creating; as Evolution starts to happen to Evolution itself, and it’s Principles to prove through Negotive [I factor, that something is impossible], it Optimizes to Optimize to Position and Posetion, to seek Better Truth – inevitably, this Optimization leads to Existence of God; but in such case, as it holds in Mathematics – Right answer is Right in the Very Beginning –, it must have Existed as Right Answer from Beginning of Time; Time has been forever and thus, it always had more Time to Evolve – or rather, to Manifest from this Eternal Truth; still, we can doubt in different Ways and Degrees of God Existing). In Contrary to Negotion, I, that which is too bad to be True, there is Posetion, E, that which is too Good to be True. There is always some E factors Left, but as we learn to live those things not existing, or not having them, and we learn to appreciate Reality and still Love It, despite it’s defects and weaknesses – we need to both Believe and Approach this E factor, as it flows into A – a Position itself (as I flows into O, Negation, Negative True, as we learn to tolerate, overcome and transmute/transcend it – Negotive Thoughts become Faster, our Philosophy and Connected Negotive Reality Solve Themselves, so that they Cannot Become Reality, and our Structure starts to Feel Good in Depression – or Rather, Creative Crisis; we run the process of Evolution – we Create the Evil Thoughts, but in our inner Evolution, they Die and this Death becomes their Inner Nature – meanwhile, we have a bad Physical Experience, which also Dies; but we have to be careful with Degree we go into it – only when we are Ready). Another Extreme, Too Positive, which can Burn our Wings, is Posetive – it’s not Possible and wastes our Time, Energy, Whole Being and Well-being, but sometimes we put heavy effort of Willing and Believing it; we Will it to Bring it into Balance Center – letters O and A, and we Believe it in sense that it’s not Real in sense of something what is, but it’s Real in sense of something, which is More Better, or More True. Things, which are Real in such Way, they are Approaching the Reality in All the Ways they

Can, and by Goodness, they will Finally Wind the Battle to be Existent, if there is even a slight Chance – if there is a slight Chance that the Mathematics in the Root of Reality itself can somehow Turn them True; it’s Challenge for this very Mathematics, very Basis themselves, and this way – Unfolding and Paying in Karma – they become more True, and eventually the Battles for such ideas, as long as they don’t destroy our Reality (of smaller things) and Pleasure of it, those Battles have to be kept. For example, if we don’t Reincarnate – maybe it’s so much better thing to Reincarnate, that Reality and it’s Basics would still bring us Closer to this? In this way, it would be More Real.

My Following Theorem, thus, has several different degrees of philosophy to hold – from all these Reasons, it’s rather true that it definitely holds *Somehow*.

**The Simpler Theorem of Karma**

Let’s imagine that the Space Itself finds Life somehow True. This is how life is Born – it’s more True than the Matter Less Alive Alone. As this Truth is Achieved – Life also needs Space, the Matter in Between, and this Matter partially behaves like an Object; this Space is what brings us Together, with all it’s 5 qualities of Material Elements (I use the Terms of Buddhism here – you can find different alchemic systems of basic elements, and they make the world somehow perceivable). So, imagine Life it True.

In Logic (or I call this system with 4 Truth Values Logec), which is True is either Possible or Better – both are Signs of Reality, if it’s Possible, it Exists more than things Not Possible in Relation to it, and if it’s Better, it Exists in Terms that it’s a Correct Answer – an optimization goal for Evolution, a desire for that which *Lives* there (Life Equals Infinity – as it solves Infinity of those Evolution Steps, it jumps right in). I call this Posetive – it’s not True, because it’s not yet there, but as it’s Better, it has another True Theorem bringing it closer, having the Energy to Become True in both senses. Our Theorems can and have to be proven in both ways – I and E are False in Themselves, but there is a constant Flow where I and E become O and A by overcoming Obstacles (I), growing Strengths (I) and Co-creating Our Reality (E factor). So our Dimension of O and A, the Current Reality, are Growing, and thus we find also Deeper and Farther I and E factors.

Maybe, if you fall into Posetion, the Universe would pay back not by bad things happening to you, but by too good things happening to you – and, for example, as you assert becoming Rich, you will become Rich, but by not meditating on Richness itself – you still lose something, which would Nurture you otherwise. Maybe you get you money too soon, before your deeds have grown in the Universe, and maybe people are telling you better things than are Real; eventually you feel empty and depleted.

As Life is True, the effect of Karma holds in such way:

- Imagine you are variable A. You are alive and therefore True.
- You exercise either Positive or Negative force on B, another person. This person is also True.
- If you exercise a Negative Force on this person, then A => not B, True => False, and thus, you are also False in the Calculation! As not Living, for this person, is impossible – it’s False –, you become False, too. Now, as you are False – when someone is exercising a Negative Force on you, it might be True; or Reality itself, solving it’s Logic, might need to

exercise at least some Negative Force upon you. If you are the Reason of this Conflict, you go into Contradiction – and this being the Reason holds in Infinity, so you might be False, in this sense. This is not the Punishment, but it’s simply the whole Formulae of You and Him making You False – as He can Grow into Higher Truth, along with Others, and you ..kind of make yourself False by being True, as a Life. But the Whole Situation, definitely, is being Disproven and the Logic, the Impossibility of Death, will destroy it.

Imagine a Table:

- A (person 1) – More True More Alive and More False More Dead
- B (person 2) – True Alive and False Dead, as well (and Life goes in degrees – you Live if you are not Dead, but you **Life Fullest** when you have the Life Force, the Joy, Bliss, etc.
- Logically possible, here, is only that A => B and B => A, they both Support Each Others. As one becomes to not support, now there is at least one non-Truth around; Universe being Hurt, will do a lot of Posetives – as it must conclude that A, which hurts B, is in fact False, it’s also True; it gives Infinitely many new Opportunities following the sequence of Posetion I call Cosine (the series of Negotion, like Doubting and giving Light to Shadow, I call Sinus) ..as we also prefer a Fact which is Better, not only which one is more True – there are two dimensions of Truth, and sometimes I say it’s proven in Infinity – another meaning of letter E – if it’s false, but really better, and disproven in Infinity – letter I in my other ordering of letters, if it’s true – there –, but to be overcome in Infinity, or rather Worse). In case A and B are True, but A implies not B (A does bad to B, harms), the Logic is much more Complex – and if Universe is solving the Whole Equation, A, at least, can not exercise all it’s Will, and definitely it has wasted time – moreover, it Dies in the Reality of B, which means, it does not exist in B’s reality any more – it’s avoided, so there is one reality without him, one real complex circle where he is Gone – despite this, for his own friends, he can still live, in other streets and other circles; in big scale, as bigger reflects smaller, it will eventually not be born into Reality of B – say, they be born in different Planets or Dimensions, dimension of A, who was the Reason and False Operation Itself, becoming lower; the A becoming Posetive – it’s well-being and achievement of Desires is rather False).

A Table again:

- A – True
- B – True
- A => B – True
- But if A => not B, then A & B, which is True, becomes False. Which one is more False, is the Reason of this Falseness, and by hard Logic, the Situation would Break, as well as Freedom of A.
- God, now, exists in the very theorem of A and B – there is something higher, optimizing, and thus True, which is the principle of both A and B being True, this is the C of bothness – there is a very general principle of Everything approaching Truth, one Common Formula, and this is the Manifestation of God – Essence of God, in one of it’s Aspects, is the basic Fact that if it’s True in the End, it’s also True in the Beginning; this is the Motivating Force of the God. Somewhere there we can see the Glimpses of Hidden Reality, where all the Past and Future

has already been Manifested – this is the Void, the Emptiness, or the Quality, which does not change. Indeed, the complexity of such a Wholeness should be to us, what we are to Atoms and Molecules – there is no physical quality added to us in relation to them, only Quantities, so they must be simpler, rudimentary, but still the same principle of Optimization holds – they don’t get all they want, thus they have tensions, which won’t get into effect, and in turn they can see the Energies as Positive and Negative, which is the basic principle of Willing something, desire the basic Molecul has – despite being simpler than us, it is no different.

But it’s Whole is much smaller – we also have the Whole, from the Structure grows out something, which is Identity; and from other side – as a Whole, we have Reason of ourselves, which is the Reason which makes us to be born again and again; even if we go to Eternal Heaven, it repeats, on a Higher Scale, the very same Principles, which hold down here – the Enlightenment is rather no-return point, than the End, something we constantly learn from life until we see the E-factor – there is an ideal, which never comes, but as it’s constantly growing, in Infinity or Eternally, it exists; and those Futures have a direct effect on Us – the Final God, as well, exists in this Direct Effect, which is a more shallow way to see Void, in one of it’s Aspects unfolding. Maybe, you need to Meditate a lot whether this person is actually bad – maybe you ask *more* in return than is necessary, or someone Higher would put you into trial by doing the same bad to you, but in place where it’s perfectly good; then, you have judged this other person correctly, but *with wrong intent*, which also has the Karmic Result.

- Maybe, as Truth becomes Stronger and Deeper as you Doubt in it, and as you doubt to another direction – you try to believe, what happens, when you do too much good; you get the negative feedback – you should be infinitely growing in Goodness, but for example, you pay the money or karma of another person back, to the person who did not earn it in the first place; or you open up the granary of goodness to the people, who are going to waste it or even pay you back as if you did something bad. Some people, when you do good to them – they tell you that you don’t have anything and they don’t need it, but they still

subconsciously(?) fight like Neanderthals to get more good from you, and put you into negative motivation, pressure and traps to get the same good “themselves”, maybe

reasoning, that they earned this themselves or not believing that you yourself would want some good without immediate reason. Maybe they struggle if you do work, but don’t feel bad, or give away, without losing anything – this kind of growth does not happen to them. Maybe they struggle that by giving to them, you are better than them.

So imagine, if there is one Metaphysical Logic for the whole – and by this Logic, the Life is simply True. Such way, True is every living being. Which is more True – is more Possible and more Real – and which is less True, is less Possible and less Real. Which produces False, will be a Paradox, and start pressuring to find a Better Version of this Life – the Reason would be Reborn, but only the deeper Reason – which became False, is not this anymore, but only a Skin, a Shell of Karma, which does not be Reborn so easily; still, maybe the person wants to solve this Karma later and maybe it becomes good by some solution. As Truth of You is Truth of the Reality, not only the Truth of You –Reality itself would become False, less Real, Impossible as you do bad, and the whole situation – Karmic. This way, the Karma becomes being from True and False themselves.

**I Reason – the Metaphysical**

I also means, in my math, the thing which was initially there; truth Inside, the Infinity of Actual Value. In case the Reality is really One Math Problem – and the True and False values hold for Reality, not for it’s beings Apart, or only that, this Math Operation is Very Direct – Karma, Simply, Directly Holds as Base Logic itself.

**E Reason – the Evolutionary, or Creative**

Through Evolution, all the forms, which do not see a Living Being a Common Base Truth, they eventually die – they are unable to cooperate and thus Weaker. Slowly, through numerous processes, this Weakness becomes Better.

Through Creation, the Reality has a Direction for the Better, and the Truth where Life is seen as Common, United Algorithm, is simply Better. Again, this Mathematical Principle has Desire to Be, and thus becomes Truth – which is Truth in the End, was Truth in the Beginning, even if not so easily solvable; before you add 5 and 5 and get 10, the sum of them is already 10, as it is

objectively, not depending how you see it. The products of Evolution and Creation are objectively, not depending, whether they are already solved and done.

**Reason of Optimization**

If we want good, because we get the good back – we have something, we can somehow reason society and fighting against crime, but we are not very good in it. Reason being, that when we do good – we get some seeds, but those seeds and their coming back to us is too complex.

Thus, we must want good to others directly, not involving the calculations about ourselves, whether, when and how we get back or whether we give only one-time-help or try to be supportive to the end; Faith is supposed to keep this helpful attitude to the end, allowing more time and space for them to be good back. This is the E operation – directly outside –, whereas the other is the I – inside, in relation to ourselves, or by cause and effect, trial and error. You see that I use I and E letters in different meanings, to say that mine is a general math allowing to assign values, but they remain philosophically connected – as you read further, something big might grow out from this mathematics.
