# The Power of Negative Thinking

**The Power of Negative Thinking**

I have seen many sources with information of power of positive thinking – the first thing I feel is a fear, that when they continue this indefinitely, something more real than their thinking can suddenly come on their way.

This something more real can be a law of logic, enemy, or even that living in their own bubble of positive thinking, they create the shadow outside of themselves – instead of creating it inside and trying to solve it, it appears completely outside.

**Negativity in some sources**

**Negativity in Jewish religion and The Kybalion**

I found this thing in Jewish religion: If you create a circle of light around you, equally strong darkness appears outside this circle. This, by many means, is true.

In Kybalion it states that every good thing has a negative past, and that every positive thing has a cycle of creating equally strong negative thing, periodically. The author of Kybalion talks about a “hack” against this, and the “hack” is positive thinking – I really think the original rules of Hermes are true, but the way his followers interpret it – the “hack” – is not so true at all. I like the Laws of Hermes, but the “scientific” story and especially the result of being over the negative, I think I don’t like all the concepts the author creates around the Laws of Hermeticism; I think it should be seen in different way. I also think that the desire to create a positive outcome – like success, money, power – is more like witchcraft (in the bad sense of the word) and maybe this lack of light is how hermeticism created a self-destructive Karma in the medieval (sure, this does not mean I would not think the attackers could be criminals). I don’t know the individual stories, but the kind of success-based thinking created there; it might be the reason why they suddenly started to struggle. In every personal story of struggle, you can always find some weakness of karma; something they did not win – this, anyway, is not an argument on side of their attackers; I think when Cosmos allows an attack, it often leaves the attackers still guilty. You always have to look your own karma, because it’s the only thing you can make better. In this sense, it’s all your own guilt. But, we could all live in a better world if we treated each others better; so that less good karma could be needed – in some stories, it’s quite impossible how good the karma of a person has to be to come out “without scars”.

I think that when one attributes those problems mentioned in Jewish mythology and Hermesis with shallow positive thinking, the seeds of the darkness remain, and it’s absolutely very clever to hit back somewhere – either hitting us or hitting others (I usually mention the Karma here, but hitting others comes so much sooner and more obviously that it’s easier to find the truth by considering this fact).

**Negativity in Christian and Pagan mythologies – the Sacrifice**

In pagan mythologies, we often see a strong desire for sacrifice – much is going on around this. The human and animal sacrifice – those are the lower forms ..but the essence of having a sacrifice to progress, this has a long and deep history; among many other things, in pagan mythology, this high trait is often mixed with what is to be seen as crime today. Coming from old ages to today – we can see that many virtues of them now seem as crimes; but we have to go to the roots and understand

the basic archetypes, which are the virtues. We can see they could follow them in two ways – good or bad.

Future might see our highest qualities and virtues as crimes – the polarity appears again and again; there are polarities backwards, in sense that what used to be good, now seems as being opposite of good; but also, this good it’s related to – in future, today’s highest virtues can be seen as crimes as well. As we defend our money and well-being, create walls and healthy protections; in future, the ways to do this can be so much more subtle, that they see all this activity as a crime. I call this point a Cosine, where the Truth Value breaks again into two opposites, creating an opposite on higher end of the value, in growing direction, not on the lower end, in shrinking direction. On number scale, I believe, opposite is not happening only once at point zero (or point one), but it happens recursively. Again and again, polarities appear on the number scale.

We can see revolutionaries often talking about our highest virtues as being crimes; one of such was the Jesus Christ. I must mention that I’m a Buddhist, and Buddhists have seen God being born at many places in the world – reincarnations and manifestations mentioned in Bible, Christ and his Father, seem as legitimate reincarnations to me; I can understand the Godly mindset of Christ and the Godly nature of His Words.

We can see that Story of Christ is a Story of Negativity – somehow, God saw this whole negative life as something very “positive”, somehow this made sense for him, so strongly, that the sense overtook him and made him go through this series of events in blood and flesh, and as written to Bible, taking the full amount of emotional charge and seriousness. We can see that somehow, negativity made up something like “Truth”.

Followed by that, Christians had a long history of culture of sacrifice and suffering, which were seen as virtues. I think that today, Christianity has lost some of this, becoming kind of petty bourgeois.

**Negativity in work of Carl Custav Jung and Psychology**

Carl Custav Jung once stated that having negative emotions and thoughts together with positive ones is a healthy harmonic system of emotions, where all the different tones are covered like in a good piece of music.

Him, or one book about healthy family (I cannot remember, which one) also stated that depression can not be seen as utterly negative, as it’s deep subconscious mind solving a deeper problem of us.

From this I can state that if it’s solved by shallow means, the problem would not get solved.

**The force of negativity**

**Theorem based on reality**

The negativity in Kybalion, and many works of how to create business mind or how to be enlightened, is seemingly proving the negative thought and emotion as fallacious by stating that it manifests in reality. If negative thing manifests only in our thoughts, might not be seen so false – as it appears in reality, it must be, indeed, that it has a bad karmic consequence.

I think in reality, the Truth is expressed through positive and negative. Positive is the force, which works through becoming; and negative is the force, which works through unbecoming. Sometimes,

where I see positive as the enversion (I use this word for upper inversion) I could call the normal positive as “Neutral”. I think that yes, our thoughts and the weakness appears in reality, but the statement that this has to be taken with complete ignorance and rejection, is an utterly sick solution.

Modern psychology, on the main stream, seems to be based on this sick solution – hardship in someones life, when it’s created by negative thinking, is seen as psychological problem; instead, it might be health.

As the negative force appears in reality, the reality itself starts to cure from this – the Forces of Nature, as they experience the negative aspects, they transcend this negativity. The Reality becomes False, and this is the force to become *more deeply True*. We have to consider that such negativity cannot become *reality*, irreversible constitution, but it’s rather like a vaccination – but it can be strong enough to make our lives harder.

**Shallow and Deep waters**

I think that overcoming the negativity, which means – living through this complex, irrational and unexplainable paradox – creates a *deep*, *meaningful* personality. Pretending the goodness creates a *shallow*, *meaningless*, or *false* personality.

Deepness, by many means, is attribute of negativity, which has been exceeded, whereas shallowness is the positivity, which is able to survive only in it’s own shallow waters and has barely seen anything.

I think even in story of God we find a strong element that by *experiencing* something, God wants to become *deeper* – post-Christ God, in the material manifestation, must be deeper and thus stronger Force than pre-Christ God; which somewhat reasons why, sometimes, the pre-Christ Gods have seen as false Gods. Even Pagan Gods must have been some reincarnations of God – but, maybe, their teachings for those times were lower than the current teachings represented by later

reincarnations. Maybe the God has to fight with His words from previous reincarnations – I cannot avoid but I see *something* in those negative actions of Catholics; despite the fact that I see Scientific Revolution as completely inevitable, I see the Catholic Revolution the same way – and I cannot avoid also the fact that there happened many crimes as well, so they are guilty the same time. I see that today, Science and mainstream culture, also the culture of offices and governments, have become dogmatic skepticism – which, itself, seems to be a contradiction – skepticism without the end. We can see that Philosophy, including Skepticism – it is a process, but it becomes dogmatic if doubt and non-knowledge itself is seen as end goal; if people start to *believe* in some *lack of facts*, making the process of ongoing philosophy seemingly be an end result, a solution itself. We can see many illogical constructs about religion and God, and we can see many ways it can be misused, especially when it has power – we can say the same about science. I think the same war, which had Christians against Pagans, and Science against Christians – now will have something, maybe we can call it Spirituality, against Science. I think the Deeper Force of Revolution is Alive and it does not change it’s nature. Indeed, when the older revolutions were more bloody, the newer revolutions tend to happen on more subtle levels of culture, business and democratic power; many means have been invented to make the revolutions more peaceful, and democracy itself is such tool, as well as science – it ensures that argument is used instead of sword. But, still, we have to use clever and practical means, we cannot simply argue with an atheist – rather, something material and stronger needs to be created. Turning back to where I started this paragraph, for a moment – in the story of Christ I see that God, indeed, saw the meaning of negativity so deep that he decided to live it in

blood and flesh, with whole seriousness and complete emotion. This is how the story of Christ goes. We can see that in past reincarnations – and I personally more follow Brahma, or Shiva – the same God managed to live in much greater harmony and positivity; and in stories of pagans, gods lived the lower virtues, which were the highest of these times, or their teachings for these times. I really appreciate all those cultures as evolution of thought, and many deep truths might been expressed in simpler and more direct ways through pagan “religions”. Definitely, who followed them, were the highest of their times, and definitely, we can learn from the whole story. Also, pieces of high wisdom have been expressed throughout the Time. But we can see in anything, including in God, that future is higher than the past.

**Examples of Negative Thought**

Deduction is a logical process, where you collect all the possibilities, and negative possibilities die – it’s the *evolutionary method of thought*. Associate this with god Shiva.

Rationalization is a logical process of here and now; it does not assume anything, neither good or bad, but it continues the tradition and established truth.

Induction is a logical process of positive end, where you collect all your truth and continue with hypothesis that by following the principles even further, you can create a more positive picture for the future.

You cannot be without some kind of deduction, I think – you try different combinations, and some of them become disproven.

I think an Evolution can be seen as God thinking through Deduction; by trying out all the

combinations and disproving the ones, which are false. Evolution follows the everyday Karma – it’s a Mathematical Law, which does not involve it’s own criteria of Truth and Wrongness, but follows the normal course of Karma.

**Fragility**

Nassim Nicholas Taleb used the word fragility for somewhat similar conception to which I want to express (also in I Ching, you can see extreme Yang, extreme good, suddenly becoming Yin – in beginning parts of classical philosophy, maybe I should have been mentioning that).

Fragility is the name of weakness I attribute to positive thinking.

I think you can see this as fact:

- As you participate in strong positive thinking, it creates according reality and becomes a fact.

I think this fact is *fragile*. It’s like a Yang – good – force, which becomes stronger and stronger, and then breaks. Christian science became stronger and stronger, until it broke; the same can be said about all the waves of Western culture, and the waves of other cultures. This “strength” is coming from two factors – the culture does not doubt, any more, in it’s measures of success, and, it avoids all the misfortune on the way.

I think, inside and outside, completely positive systems, including humans, are bound to break. This could even happen in a way that they completely succeed in their way, but this way suddenly turns out to be much weaker than the ones, which have been going through negative. So the positive

attitude cannot express it’s success by becoming true, by the positive events really happening and becoming consistent – this is a measurable degree, but I think that the interplay of positive and negative is much more consistent proof; the case of overcoming the inner and outer problem, not avoiding it completely. Negativity, it has it’s breaking point where it becomes fatal – but, similar quality can be found in positivity, which also suddenly becomes fatal. Louis XIV can be seen as an example – I think he is an example of a really positive monarch, who really did not bring negativity into it’s life, he seems to live in a positive affirmation, including one of self-worth.

**Inner and Outer Growth**

Negative forces, which are born inside us, have different names. It can be depression, or deeply sensed meaninglessness.

I think that it works like an evolution – it kills the negative factors in our life, character, thoughts and feelings; our negative connections, and thus forms the Space for something Positive to be born. This process of Negative Transcension goes through great loss and pain. But, to be positive here, we must not overcome this loss and pain, but we must get so much stronger that we see the deep, positive outcome in ourselves and in society.

The feeling of meaninglessness – it does not take anything away, but it’s the negative force unbecoming. We must have *balance* in it, as the negative aspect must not get so strong that it becomes fatal; we also must delay it – not enter this before we are ready; and we must really see that we *never* reach an ideal state, so we always enter the Dark Night of the Soul – but the Negative itself also grows *higher*, so all the process is smoother and smoother for us. But as Kybalion states as *Theorem* (ancient), and then avoids with a *hack* (modern) – we cannot avoid that this negative force must always be in action in it’s full power.

Every once and a while, the *higher ideal wants to become*, and thus it renders our *highest ideals into negativity*; thus, we feel pain and emptiness. We become no more empty than we were, tough some things not serving us any more might disappear and there might be a visible emptiness in our lives, for a while. It becomes fatal if it’s not directed to it’s good ends – transcending us to the state where this emptiness does not exist any more.

The society, as well, needs to experience it’s emptiness; the personality, who creates this feeling, is called a *revolutionary*. Revolution takes our highest virtues and sees them as hellish sins – this is the work of revolutionary, that he sees everything from the perspective of higher society, which would already destroy us as pagans; instead, we have to destroy ourselves with our own scrunity. Then, we are reborn into higher beings – this is the conscious evolution we can do.

So we can see that which starts to be empty, can be:

- Our personality, patterns of thoughts and feelings; our life.
- Our social connections, friends, bosses, coworkers.
- Our society, government and offices-in-effect.
- Our spiritual culture and belief, both personal and shared ones.

When we start to feel empty, we might lose them in process of evolution – the forces become extinct –, and we can change so much that it’s a different person; a different society; a different sphere of friendship. But as we start feeling the emptiness and depression, nothing is really taken

away – we start to experience our existing lack, and we do not fall, but we are realizing that we were already fallen. As nothing ideal will never come, we enjoy every stage for a while – this is the purpose, and we have to enjoy the process as the end of it never comes. But once done, we have to see this as empty – we are lucky if our friends do the same, but more often we have our own time and the friendship, many social structures in our lives, fall apart, and we are faced with this emptiness in it’s own power; we start to experience this as perceived reality. We see the negative aspect itself, and lose the positive illusion we had.

This is a process of Creation, and this is the process of Shiva – as God takes away from us, we start to seek; and what we find is higher than what we ever had. The negativity, as we work through it, becomes a positive force, a shield protecting us from the lowness, which was sensed as highness before. As we only have positive aspect of our lives, this is also material – we cling to our friends, ego, personality and the ego of society believing in all it’s social and official structures; also, the social structure of officials, psychologists and business or social circles – in their own trap of positive thinking, they can see us as a failure, as a person having a social or psychological problem.

Instead, what happens, is that we transcend all this:

- What position we seek in life. Which are our thought and emotion patterns.
- What kind of friends and their circles we look for, which are the patterns for us to make friends, which kind of companies we look for, and which kind of success all the people around us are looking for in us.
- What kind of God we believe in; our conception of God, or a Force in Universe, will definitely be raised; and thus are those forces in our lives – in a sense we create our God, as He cannot help us unless we seek help; maybe the picture of God in ancient societies was simply what they could understand (somehow, deeply, I feel that God in material world of manifestation must grow and experience – I do not see this Negative Aspect being false, because God is Perfect; I think Negativity itself is attribute of Perfection, it exists in matter, in manifestation, in past, in form of Yin).

**My Word Use**

As I see negative positivity and positive negativity, I must see Logic as false – in Logic, you kind of assume that positive is always true; logical thoughtlines, which won’t assume this, are really complicated in Logic.

I use the following system of Four Truth Values:

- Negotive or *Negotion* – this is the negative to be avoided, without a deeper meaning. I call this principle Sinus, that we still dwelve into this force – as we become Stronger, we go even through this; it’s a Force too negative to become reality, but we go through it’s *Danger Zone*.
- Negative or *Negation* – this is the negative to be sought for, these are the adventures and cold showers, fasting and other “sacrifices”. It’s also the logical deduction, where we prove a theorem by showing the opposite to be false – we go through something negative to disprove it. It must not become an actual reality. This force is the *force of experience*, it’s a Force, which *works to unbecome*. It becomes hidden, like subconscious shadow, unless we *enlighten it*, and when we enlighten it, it creates a negative manifestation also into our life. This can be seen as failure, but really is not.
- Positive or *Position* – this is the positive force to be sought for, and even with four truth values, it’s often the way to express; so you still express through the “power of positivity”, but logecally (I call my system logec, not logic), you go through negative principle. I call this positive thing a cone, as a mathematical form, and cone means positive and the overcoming negative.
- Posetive or *Posetion* – this is the positive force to be avoided. For example, we don’t want to bet only on unrealistic plans, and we don’t want to keep the false friends and characters – in different ways, those things become posetive. The process I call “cosinus”, where we still enter the posetive aspects, believing a little bit in fallen people, or concentrate a little bit into ideals we cannot achieve. By this, the attribute of *dimensionless* is being outcase, we want to get over the fact that we do not have these dimensions.

So the Negative becomes kind of Positive by not having a dimension, and the lack of dimension of Positive becomes, then, kind of negative – if we have an ideal, but it has no dimension, we cannot pursue it, we must do something with our actual lives.

I call this reasoning process a *Ponegation*, where I use the Truth Values Negotion, Negation, Position and Posetion. I sometimes use the word “Neuton”, where it’s either Negation or Position, and the O-Neuton (I write upside-down U instead of O), where it’s either Negotion or Posetion. Those Neutons I use also when plane of Logec itself goes up or down – the very basis of our logic, or the logic in effect in reality, goes up (Neuton) or down (O-Neuton).

I use those words in my mind to further remove any doubt that the Power of Negativity is needed.

**The Being of Negativity**

I think that in reality, the Negative Force has as much senses, will and cleverness, as the Positive Force. In reality, where Negative Logic becomes to be, it’s inner drive is to unbecome – but it does not do this directly, but it plays a complex game of it’s own.

In Physics, this must be attributed that by Negativity, the particles and fields must have their *success* and *failure*, a process of Karma, not only a perfect reaction. They have desires and dreams, higher states, and they avoid lower states. So there must be struggles and pains, which are not seen by physics, when we assume that imperfection does not exists. I think that throughout the material plane, anything associated with Yin, the flaws and imperfections must exist, and thus, for a physical process, something is more perfect or desirable than another thing – thus, the particles have some kind of feelings and to achieve material manifestation, we must get better Karma in this material field. It’s a whole study of science like physics, or alchemy, which has not even started to grow. Matter also has another form of karma, the interkarma – it has to support life. Maybe, the matter is there because of the Space element of Life – it needs Space, it cannot simply grow together with another piece of Life; it needs environment, objects, etc. So the Material Principle is forever there – the enlightenment of matter is not in it’s becoming Completely Life, somewhere it has to balance and have a healthy amount of Life and healthy amount of Space.

I think the Negative process is clever, tricky, alive force in Cosmos.

**The Negativity of a Species**

We see this only in bad light when an Alien comes and destroys humankind. This means our *being of object* has *ego*. In the world, which counts objects, there is an ego-dimension – it wants to keep it’s forms, it falls into belief of which objects it has formed in the past.

I believe in reincarnation ..but lately I considered: when I find a much higher person than myself, fulfilling my deepest goal, I must let go of my form, my presence; this form, maybe it comes in different set of beings than me – but my most original reason would change. I would be kind of dead, the cycle of reincarnation being passed to others. I decided that for my Zen attribute – I really believe my Soul is forever, raising personality in quite linear scale, every new me is a new person, so the old person is not him, but he himself is completely the old person. I will be everything I was, plus something more. But should I become unreasoned, False, I should disappear – and as the original instinct, my deepest being, is my reason; I am this reason in material and mental plane – this deeper reason would enjoy; so I should be enjoying this kind of disappearance.

So, should the human race change so much that it is not a human race any more, or should it meet so much higher different race that it becomes meaningless – I think the original Karma, the Principle, which gave us the Form, will enjoy more being represented in those newer Forms of Life, than in us. It should be acknowledged that we enjoy more when Cosmos, and all the Essence, becomes those higher beings, and those lower beings no longer exist.

By not climbing into it’s past personalities, the Principle, which holds together the *Objects* of us, or the *Persons*, becomes enlightened – whole Karma, the whole Sphere of Beings will be born again, the whole Deep Reason is satisfied, but they are not the same beings, the same race, the same species – they are something new.

By letting go the clinging to our Person and our Race or Species, and leave room to idea that we really exist because we satisfy the original reason, not because we are used to exist; it fills much more deep desire in us than clinging to the Ego of *Principle of Persons*.

I think we are nothing more or less than the *Reasons* in Space, all those Reasons must get Form, so, mathematically, they form such Units, Persons or Objects. To meet again with this deeper reason, we must not believe this Objectness of us, but in the Force, the Reason, which made the Objects to be.

So if a better alien race suddenly destroys us – it might be a process of growth. We might have become posetive.

**The Negation in Evolution**

Yin: In the deep beginning of Evolution, there is some Dark Creative Force – it creates Many Forms, but does not guarantee them going to the end. It’s Creative Force, as it can create so many possibilities or combinations, but it’s Dark, as it does not know it’s end. Then, the Natural Selection is a Deduction in this Thought Process of God. This is the principle of Shive.

Yinyang: In Present, we can be very different people, a very different race or species. We can choose, who we are, and thus, by our free will, the point, where the evolution has reached, is very different. This current presence, and making the best out of it, is the force of Vishnu. By just being different, we change the present state of evolution and attribute it a creative, self-deciding force, by which our Karma will make the *selection*.

Yang: The strong Sex Drive, the Love, and the Higher Love, which creates Soul Families – probably the connection, which decides their future love and recombination of Genes; also, maybe, the God’s Force connecting the couples, this is the Yang force of Evolution, it’s the Creative. Love and Higher Love are the principles, by which the small families and the great future families grow together – this alchemy is so strong, but it does not happen in microscopic level, but in complex sphere of being.

In yinyang principle, we can probably change a lot our current genes and especially their meaning. The Yin becomes more creative over time – the evolution also happens with evolution, the way in which genes combine, evolves and thus, becomes creative like we have became. I don’t know, whether we are past this point – but it’s the inevitable result of evolution.

To see the Truth and Harmony, God in Reality, we have to see Evolution as Mathematically Bounded Process – it creates forces of Ethics, and the Best Combinations, in mathematically stable way, thus being a Thinking and Creative process, not Dead, Blind or Random. It’s not against our religious sense that such process exists, but it’s the Negative (Not Negotive!) aspect of God.

**Negation in All it’s Forms**

We can see it as everlasting aspect of Yin, something, what never ends. We become stronger, start to feel it in more positive way, and see it’s part in greater harmony. It happens on physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual plane, and creates an *experience*.

As a Force, it’s clever and intelligent to *maximize the effects of experience*; this is the Wisdom of Lack – it’s a Desire, a Positive Force, which mathematically happens in this Negativity, that with clever ways and tricks, it wants to unbecome. But it cannot simply go away, this is an *ignorance* – Negative Force is not *ignorant*, but it’s also a Force to become Enlightened.

By this Force to become enlightened, we get some tough feeling that our emotional system is not getting broken by negativity – we transcend all those low vibrations into something higher, so they become our shields and victories without the battles.

We must see that if what feels the Good and the Bad is the Theorem, the Reason; then, even the Negativity must have a Theorem and a Reason – this is the part, which lives. So the holes have senses, the shadows have their will – they want to take us through the experience, which makes us strong. There cannot be less of negative force – there will always be more; but it can be more enlightened – by light, attention; not by darkness and avoidance. This principle will definitely do it differently from positive force, which wants to be – a negative force is in kind of paradox, where it has to be without being; it has to constantly “destroy” us, make it seem less meaningful, for example, but it must not destroy us.

In this sense, that the negative force must not break us – I believe also in positive. But I think that even in the deepest, for the future lifetimes, we grow something up; or, for the future generations. Being a problem is not always a bad thing – we can be complex problems, instead of trying to get motivated for something not making sense anymore.

**Doubting in our Definition of Virtues**

We can simply start going in direction of money and power, creating a character, which magnetizes those principles. But, going deeper, we can see that this character, this money and this power do not

satisfy us – we need to change, to search the character we want to create; instead of assuming that this is the character embodying all the positive qualities as we and our society see them.

My fathers family was once a Billionaire family – fallen with a revolution. There, they could also study that money is not the main reason, the main guarantee; it must get much deeper.

**Avoidance of this principle**

I can see it in positive affirmations of American business psychology, and this kind of psychology can be analyzed as if it was magic – I think, it cannot be a stable and everlasting force. American spiritual people are the ones, who go most into this yes-culture.

Society, by it’s labeling, diagnosis and sometimes even violent acts into our lives, can measure us completely from the aspect of Yes-saying, so that our broken relations with the past are seen as sickness; their energy and our taxes do not go into the outgrow of deeper connections and experiences. I think spiritual people pay double-taxes – for some reason, we also pay for the offices and structures, which kick out the people, who become spiritual. Taxes of those people, once they get on legs again, and their supporters, should be taken specially, not be measured by “common norm” of positive thinking.

I Kybalion, and in Hermeticism, and in some teachings under the name of Secret Societies – I see also that this positive force must be achieved by all means.

By whichcraft and paganism – their sin was directly seeking for positive qualities, such as money and power. This can harm others and destroy your deeper direction.

**Toughtness**

To overcome being broken through negative principle, we need a quality of “toughtness”. This means that we go through negative process, but our mind is not broken. Boddhisattvas are said to be enjoying this, it’s said that even when they are tortured by evil enemy, they won’t lose their clarity –they don’t get broken. If you don’t get broken, your soul is growing through the process; you are growing through any negative process, but if you don’t balance and stabilize this, if you don’t take the vaccines in little doses, this moves into indefinite future. If you integrate the negative aspects into your character, not clinging to positive parts of the cycle of life – you fall less into completely negative; if the negative energies are free day-to-day basis, they won’t get destructive, but do their job (you just look a little more serious and maybe skeptical).

Also the feelings like anger – it’s very destructive in early or unevolved stages, but if it’s taken into perfection, it works in a positive way; it can be rage, which guides you to build new society; a feeling, which is not hurting people, and not destroying you from inside, but already at quite high vibration. To reach this, you probably have to go through your anger starting from the phases where you are, and you must keep this thing in control so that you won’t destroy things on the way – negative force is Force only by undoing itself, it’s not a force by achieving the “goal” or the “position” of it; it Force by making the absence of such “goal” much more deeper. And as the Negative is real karma, the real causality – it exists as a Force in Reality; as a Being rather than something Dead; and what this Force Feels, is it’s consequence – it’s consequence is the logic that it wants to be gone, to “die”; by this, it becomes really alive. First, it dies something – in the future potential, there is Death. This makes a Negative Force to Be, it Becomes. Then, it Becomes Aware of Itself – this Nothingness, the Death, it becomes into Fear, into Avoidance, maybe into Ignorance;

all this needs Light, so that it can become into Clever Way of Getting the Experience Without Really Falling into it.

BTW: Make HUGE difference between enlightened negativity and it’s unconscious precessor; there is a kind of self-destructing negativity, which really needs to be overcome with something like positive thinking. So, while positive thinking might help some, it has to be taken to a new level to help all, or to help really.

**Three form of Truth**

So I take together the three forms I can see.

- The Negative Force, which is growing constantly in our life, and becoming a Power of Letting Go. This turns our normal life processes from being satisfactory into being meaningless and a thing of a past. This is an energy, which has to keep balanced – it must not grow much over what we can take. The jobs, business contacts, friends, and habits in life become unsatisfactory, and the force grows in our life to lead us away from them. This creates new challenges and we might experience lack of friends, money etc. This force is also a powerful source of the new – once we develop a criteria and a shield against what does not serve us any more, we face many psychological challenges of letting go, and the pain of the birth. We need to grow stronger mindset, which is able to go through these qualities of growth – later, we need to find new opportunities to fill this empty space of the soul.
- The Neutral Force, keeping the balance. This force is the force of stability, helping us to maintain routines and habits of sociality and economic well-being. This might be lost in times of crisis, and needs to be rebuilt back on the new levels. Being happy on this level is often being regarded as positive thinking, but can make us suffer in cases of being corrected, or feeling bad as we see the mistakes in ourselves – so that we cannot grow.
- The Positive Force, which is creating a vision of more enlightened world, society and ourselves. By this force, we create new dimensions, which are not yet possible to us – we start seeing obstacles, and we see things, which used to seem perfect, as low, criticizing them. This critics might be too much for many people. This force is the push towards doing what is impossible, becoming what is impossible, and creating new structures of society, or finding parts of it, which are up to our new criteria or growing into such. The difference of this force from the negative force – the negative force fuels us with pain from what was normal before, but this force rather seems as a dream, a strong desire and motivation to seek for more opportunities and possibilities.

**Traps of Positive Affirmations**

When social circles or officials have filled the air with positive affirmations, telling anything “bad” about anybody becomes dangerous. Thus, such organizations cannot recover, when they have done something wrong – they can have “friendship” among colleagues, and those people will not let any information in, which would realign their direction or correct past errors.

Positive affirmations also make people very nervous about revolutionary thoughts – if something is made better and their current situation depicted from this new perspective, the power of positivity

would lead them to fire or attack each others in case they let the information in. More healthy people would understand this very easily that things are going better, but with such positive expectation, people would attack the revolutionary and prove themselves “right”.

Positive affirmations, often, mean that nothing bad is being told to you – you have made a heavy circle of understanding, that when someone corrects you, it’s necessarily bad. Actual bad is when you are not corrected. Programmers of such track are painful when bugs are found in their programs; somehow they expect to do none. Very often, people make some expectations about what you meant by some sign, and you cannot correct them, because they would lose their healthy condition very fast.

You cannot talk bad about situations, where you would need so – in positive affirmation, you need to solve such situations so seamlessly that no bad sign is left to anybody, and positive affirmers would then attack people, who have some trouble with others – they go far to hide all troubles and they create false masks to show that their relationships are all OK.

Somehow it happens that positive affirmers run around and talk bad about somebody; they do so very silently and it’s hard to tell, what exactly is the problem. Such people hide the reasons of the problems, or lie that problems are not there – so you waste time for them; when they have already decided not to continue some relationship with you, they still try to deduce you that everything is OK; over long time, finally, you understand that your suspection was right.

It’s made unhealthy to laugh over people, when they do a mistake – but laugh would be a healthy correction making people to fix their mistakes. You cannot also tell them directly that they are wrong. You cannot have strong and fixed opinion about something, but you need to be polite – in old times, people with strong opinions could have a debate, but now they must leave it so that nobody has no basis at all, and everybody remains at their opinion.

When your stories are read or heard, people attribute you success and failures based on “yes” condition, based on the assumption that you wanted to get only good. They can make up stereotypes and clichés based on such assumptions. Lately, as I have solved many paradoxes in life, I see it almost every moment that people, who still have such paradoxes, solve my life into clichés as if I had such paradox – it’s almost impossible to live better.

So the positive thinkers:

- Create the superego level ego to their social structures, like classes and corporate or governmental structures, by showing all their activities as “worthy”; their social relations attribute the “correct” qualities everywhere, so when their social structures are doing mistakes, they keep the “good relations”. In return, their psychology of accepting mistakes is so underdeveloped – they do nothing to develop it – that should a mistake come out and be accepted, the reaction is kind of violent – they get the person complete outcast. So, who is messing with this self-image, is to be attacked. The process of accepting some mistake is extremely slow, as they see the picture of doing mistake itself so “violent” that when you simply point out something, for example when you feel pain about the ecosystem, they would attack you. If your solution to problems involves that others have been doing mistake, the hate of positive thinkers starts rotating around this and they fear you say this about others as well – so, finally, for example they have to protect their university degrees and thus, they respond with pain if someone, who does not have those degrees, is smarter than them. Sometimes they don’t even care, in what field the degree was given in. This ego-level

superego creates an image of their social activities and structures, which is close to ideal, and gets hurt and aggressive once this ego structure is being in danger. In return, as they protect the image and are sure that they are perfect without changing, or with constant, accepted rate of change, which they can tolerate – from their stories it turns out that you are absolutely violent, when you see better solutions for the future and start criticizing the current ones; whereas you can see that the pain should be in the current weakness and the growth should be seen as solution, and indeed, everything can be constantly improved – so it’s natural that revolutionary personality would see mistakes everywhere, and also in their own established solutions, and remain revolutionary for a lifetime; this is the result of constantly seeking improvements and looking for reasons for anything weak or wrong. This, indeed, needs that there is no pain body when your current structure of ego or superego is being endangered – rather, the social structures and offices should flow in the constant change and improval, improvisation.

- Create the self image, which needs to be protected. You cannot make a joke towards them, correct when they understand or read you wrong; you cannot say that today you have better solution than the one you suggested yesterday. They see that when you are changing, you are losing – but you are winning. The pain of the current state itself becomes a problem, it becomes a problem that you see problems; but it’s rather the energy of solution.
- As they measure you based on this truth, they create an absolute state where you are OK – you definitely don’t want to do some mistakes, you don’t want to see weakness in your situation. You are not letting go of fiends or jobs and giving away in your life to create space and pain for getting better. Thus, when they see your process of negative energy, they attribute that you are being sick; they see that you must have pain about your present, your current being, or that you might tell others that theirs is wrong as well. Thus, those people, as they get more structured and official, they might also use official means to start fighting with improval. They are greatly concerned that the image of society, it’s official titles, and in turn, the bad attitude about different societies, cultures and the same abilities and skills in persons, who don’t have those titles – must be wrong. If you have a period of search, a Dark Night of the Soul, they decide that you must be loser, and create stories about you based on their perception of positivity – I have seen insane levels of cliché, projection and

hallucination in their perceptions about people, who are not in trap of positive thinking and self-affirmations. I like to talk some “bad” about myself, point out the weakness, and behave naturally so that the weakness and mistake are visible – this opens up the space to grow, and naturally it should make it possible to help each others further and see, where the traps are.

Positive thinking, in turn, means that the complete losers I see, who only create image of themselves and react with pain when themselves or the people they connect with are seen as not perfect – they create a protection against such attributions and form a strong, fighting and outcasting structure, which starts to fight with me, and thinks that this image of me as being vulnerable and the image of themselves, which involves things like asking help of friend to do their work, but hiding the case, so that finally they get something working, they do the sales and protect every mistake or bug as a virtue in their product ..so finally, they start pushing the negative thinker away, and trying to turn their cliché into reality. This is so fast reaction that as I develop my mind to involve negative thinking, people might see, very fast, on street that this is “true” ..this is a real problem of society, which has created the psychology, which cures the case when you start feel problems with emptiness of life,

meaninglessness, troubles with climate and environment etc.; they cure the senses from the perception of the problem, until you reach the state of perceiving “well-being”, also they cure the most direct and visible signs of the problem – for example, you have really bad friends for you, who cannot fill you, but you are cured to the point, where everything is very blessed, and the relation is being perceived as very perfect from every direction; you are taught to think only about “positive aspects”. So, there are definitely breakdowns when you let go, but also in our system this should be normal that people switch jobs, and friendship or even relations are not forever – this has been a long battle, since in the past, you had to keep your job, friends and wife for a lifetime, so that this would fit the pattern of them all being perfect. Who wants to think good, and is being hurt by the negative brain structures – and does not feel them as fuel for growth ..they fall into stagnation. Also, you cannot show your truth as conviction, because this endangers truth and image of others – truth itself must be something very relative; when, if you have positive strategy to solve differences, you can see that it indeed is – but people can reach convictions, and they can doubt in what is established. And this is only illusion created by positive thinking – by creating a truly negative visions, you need to cope with them ..positive thinkers – their negative thoughts are really destructive. But negative thinkers – once they have gone through all the pain, through all the argument and battles for better plans, their ways to express negativity become so painless and fluent, and definitely non-violent; the effect of being broken and maybe hysteric or wanting suicide because of low self-worth – those negative effects go away as your Negative Force grows, and indeed, you are happy to see so many mistakes and feel that you can do a job, which is needed, to grow yourself and others; you feel good that your glass is empty or has some room, and thus you can fill it. In fact, you have more glasses to fill.

Indeed, I must say that my theory involves *more truth values*, not just yes and no – the yes value, indeed, should follow the Buddhist or other spiritual practices, creating the feeling of self-worth or accepting yourself as you are, and gaining the positive thinking. Maybe, even, these practices should be finished before you start to grow the negative thinking? I think the “yes” form, the final end, definitely has all those properties – but the negative force, like some kind of Tao paradox, has to be involved as well, in the healthy structure. You can find out all the psychological problems you can fall into if you don’t have the self-worth, or the feeling of perspective – but, you can also find out the problems you fall into, if you have created the unhealthy degree or paradigm of self-worth, which would make you feel hurt if people laugh when you say something stupid. I do not, really, laugh when people say something stupid – but I would feel much better talking with people, with who I have a different contract that we laugh, way might say “this is a foolish thought” or that indeed, you made a mistake against my definite logic. I do not see how this is violence – this is a social structure to see your mistakes, and you do not need to feel bad or attack a person when you laugh over their mistakes. I truly believe in enlightenment, where we need to overcome the dark side of the personality, but I see very strongly that this darkness is a part of our journey, the experience – this is one of my deepest paradoxes, but I have solved many instances of this paradox and thus, I have to point out that the solution is not against negative thinking, but indeed sees this as a fuel.
