# Logecs and E factor – what is bad in positive affirmations

**Logecs and E factor – what is bad in positive affirmations?**

First let me make an example of positive affirmation as used by a bad witch – “of mirror, mirror on

the wall; who is most beautiful in the world?” As we can see from the following story, this is the

worst of positive affirmations, which you can find used in well-known historic stories (stories,

which are told in our immediate history).

Move to “And – on the sickness of Positive Affirmations”, and without reading the logics part you

can still probably read it quite freely. Mathemati(/e)cs is my own math, logecs is my own logic.

**My System of Mathematical-Logical operations I call Logecs.**

**Number System (continuous)**

These are four abstract Numbers:

- I – Minus infinity
- O – Minus finity
- A – Plus Finity
- E – Plus Infinity

And two add-on positions:

- U – Zero. Or, alternatively and one octave up, it’s unknown whether it’s plus or minus finity.

If base 1 is used, it’s any of minus or plus finity or infinity – in such case the number system

is made of only one 1, or it goes up in one octave, but in infinity – on R axe. T axe is finity.

- ∩ - Point between minus and plus infinity, using inner coordinates, where the line is zoomed

out so that one infinity fits into the point. This is U in higher octave. Other component is

inverse of line going directly into infinity, until it reaches again it’s beginning. This is easier

to define logically than mathematically – for example, from a conclusion of logic, you

connect a final result with corrected input; the way logic works are often connected with

infinities – especially where you conclude something from end of your calculation into the

beginning. It can also signify, one octave up, an unknown, whether it’s plus or minus

infinity. When, on this resulting axe or R, is raised octave up at it’s minimum, on it’s sinus

function as I say, again all the four numbers would be encountered, but this is not a standard

operation – U is used alone like this, where it covers all possible numbers instead of two.

Zero and unknown are equal in sense that the given point of location is equal.

**Number System 2 (discrete; one octave up)**

- I – Minus 2
- O – Minus 1
- A – Plus 1
- E – Plus 2

O and A are connected points, which has angle backwards and forwards. Each two continuous

points are connected. So they together form zero, they form one side of the zero when alone. This is

especially useful dimension when you have the I and O signifying not the opposite of A and E, but

only lack of A or E.

And two add-on positions:

- U – Uknown of minus or plus 1. Or, Zero. Infinity octave up, it’s unknown of any number.
- ∩ - Unknown of minus or plus infinity. Or, the infinitely long, but very smooth curve

separating minus and plus infinities, and seen as points when you zoom out to those

infinities. It’s kind of equal to zero, or only two times larger, and if the number is uniformly

distributed in finity and infinity, it’s hard to discrern the two zeros. When number forms

ponegative, it’s different locally and in global optimum, the number’s actual value might

differ from local value. Local value can be position in calculation, or in process like

evolution or good ending in the end – where, in the end, survivors have more balanced

ethics and ethical outcomes, and evolution would definitely connect the repeated cycles,

which form a base of base karma. Also that the cycles are not broken, which makes them

hard to recover.

**Number System 3**

- I – Minus one
- O – Minus zero
- A – Plus zero
- E – Plus one

This is one octave down. Sometimes, IO then is minus two, and AE is plus two.

**Number System 4**

Half-octave length of frequency higher.

- I – 1 or 0
- O – 2 or 1
- A – 3 or 2
- E – 4 or 3

**Structure of Numbers**

First digit is the sign – it’s one of the four letters, or it goes inside or outside one octave. To add

digits to octaves beforehand, I insert U’s and ∩’s in digits as big as Capital letters, but looking like

small letters, definitely somehow discerning one from another in font.

The four digits have standard angles. Upwards, E makes one round angle further from zero, and the

number turns straight in infinity. Downwards, I makes one round angle downwards from zero, and

the number turns straight in minus infinity. All four numbers have the same angle between each

others. Locally, when they are not meaning infinities, as in number systems 3 and 4, the angle just points into direction of such angle.

Sometimes I use 1, 2, 3, 4 for I, O, A, E, respectively.

As a circle becomes bigger, it’s angle at one point of the circular line becomes closer to zero. When infinity is reached, it’s exactly zero – it’s the exponentially growing function, which meets a point there, where the axe of simply adding the numbers does not meet any point any more. It’s the absolute infinity, which does not exist on the number plane, as a point. When number space itself has a function of exponential growth, number with such properties on the initial, linear plane, a point infinity is not unreachable.

I use tildes on top of numbers to go further in frequency. Ì, Ò, Á, É go lower and higher in frequency, and sometimes I use 5, 6, 7, 8 for Ì, Ò, Á, É, respectively. The end angle of such numbers becomes closing the number to point smaller than the last point existing in the normal dimension – after this point comes dimension inside U, which has another dimension, the coordinate directions multiply by indefinity of infinity between. I call these numbers “smaller than zero”, but I mean the positive and neutral numbers only by saying that. Upwards, infinity gets from straight line to more and more outwards angle until it also forms a point – a degree, where it goes 360 degrees outwards in one point. Distance to infinity is shrinking by every simultaneous multiplication, or taking square, and sometimes I use this digit to show that this square has been taken.

Now, with two tildes I go more up and down, inside U or ∩ frequency.

Infinities can be smaller and larger, and for logical counterpart of mathematics, they also come to definite number scale. Infinities as small as a few natural numbers come into play when logic is involved – this means, you conclude something into beginning of your logical calculation, from the end.

By these operations, the logic is moving up or down – from the position of beginning of logical task, it has been moving up or down. In time and space, the effecting logic also goes up or down – when evolution makes a few successful iterations, the overlying logic has been moving up; when it makes a failure, it has been moving down. Also when new mutations appear, it has been moving either up or down.

Sometimes I use 0 and 9 to make connections from 8 to 1 through infinity (9) or from 1 to 8 through finity (1). 1-8 take a total possible degree from down to up, before the dimension of the number starts to grow.

The same way, zero space, 0-dimensional space would become multidimensional – any number in power 0, it would get dimensions from numbers being on equal position, but simply different. Only logically will be the 0-dimensional number thus topologically identical.

In other coordinate systems, with one or more dimensions, the ranges of numbers fit so that any higher-dimensional number can still be projected to the range of lower-dimensional number, given that the number where you project, goes over infinity. Here I use numbers, which have the positional frequency over or under one octave, which forms from the simple infinity of numbers, which you can achieve by adding a number to itself infinitely many times, for example, or doing calculations, which are directly implied.

When space get’s such curvature that lines you draw on it, grow exponentially as you add the neighboring points in linear way, becomes exponential, then functions which seem to jump from finity straight into undefined infinity, become still arranged – you can have infinitely many digits after comma. I often write digits before comma with big letters, and after comma with small letters, without then having a comma. Other times, big or small letter bring in another dimension, which would unite the lengths of two dimensions growing, into dimension where they also involve the growth of another dimension.

This is hard to read – my later math becomes much more complex. Next part will be simpler again.

Otherwise, I often use those numbers combined similarly to decimal system – I don’t describe positional system here very much, as I use them often for Logec to write the Logecal values.

**Logical operations**

The operation of number value, or the Male-aspect of operations:

- I or I – **Negotion**, the number is progressing towards negative. You avoid this, but you vibrate this number on your potential field, and give this vibration to Cosmos and Basic Laws of Nature, for your experiencing field and the Cosmic Field of Information could register and react this dimension; you need to receive the change through reaction, not directly though saying “no”. The reaction must not become real, as by conclusion of Karma, you become unreal yourself – as you imply False, you become False, and reality uses someone’s other’s values; or only some other aspect of you can become Real.
- O or A – **Negation**, the number is towards negative, but unprogressing by having still negative visible values; the value in infinity or meaningful dimension is positive, whereas the direct or visible value is negative. This is the dimension of experience – you need to gain it before starting to do something more effectively; or it’s the dimension of work – you give away something in order to gain something, you directly lose, but in infinity, you win. I say “infinity”, because the number goes over uncertainty, you cannot exactly connect it with what you gain in the future. This kind of uncertainty adds dimensions, and the connected dimension is positive.
- A or E – **Position**, the number is progressing towards positive value. This happens directly.

The speak still often has this position – as in Logic, they stay on “Yes”, in Logec, the expressed value is “Position”, unless you talk about other position – for example by saying “This is negotion that …”. If you just say “Do that”, then you mean that your Position is to do that, even if your Negation is still to not do that – in such case you are not lying. So if you apply logec to work of “positive attitude”, you get “Yes” still equal to “Yes”, and as the work talks yes-statements when not specified otherwise, it is still equal to “Position”, where not stated otherwise. It becomes “Negotion”, when you express what you don’t desire at all, in order to give it a right place on potential field.

- E or O – **Posetion**, the number, which is in position, but reacts in opposite direction or does not react, wasting the resource, which gets a posetive value. So, when posetive value happens, towards negotion there is value in the reason, and when negotion happens, there is also posetion of force, which intended good; this force virtually exists for good, which is not seen and is thus still Posetion. I connect this word with “making a pose” in Estonian, playing something positive or appearing as something positive – thus the posetion is made, when

this value is applied to be positive value. Using up the resources is made in direction of posetive axe, and it’s a posetive value as it does not imply itself (in circle of Karma, or Time).

- U or **Uneton** (or I play with words U-Newton) -
- ∩ or **∩-Uneton** -

Sometimes I also use feminine operations, which mean either values in absolute infinity, or when something is implied to another position, so that another thing becomes false as you do a false operation, for example – where the exact position or unit cannot be followed. Because, as you move in infinity dimension, this does not affect your local value, nor neighborhood – location change in infinity comes smoothly, and thus it’s more like your position is changing, than the value, and in this positional change it becomes True or False (I use saying “True or False” where all 4 values are possible, as a set covering all of the 4 values somehow). I call these four a “rosedriad”, as I tried to invert every letter in my number system. When I use big letters for those upper-octave four operations, which relate to 5-8 in number system, I use small letters for normal ponegotion (I use ponegotion and ponegation words randomly).

- **Legadriad** – The value in one position, in ponegation (male logec here, can also refer to all eight operations), somehow moves to negation in other position.
- **Legodriad** – such negotion happens that it’s hard to say in space and time, which actual objects implied it and how they were related. In the frequency of infinity, this can be complex connection between different objects.
- **Rosedriad** – this creates a posetive value in infinity.
- **Rosidriad** – this creates a position in infinity, a positive value

I think Women are born in infinity, when men are born in finty, and thus those are the four operation of men and women. I also have the words to do infinite operations in first octave and infinite operations of second, female octave. In this second octave, the values are after the infinity in outwards direction, smaller than minus infinity and bigger than infinity, but in such order that they meet in absolute infinity – where numbers get simply lost, into yet another dimension. In Driads, the numbers cannot get lost – the coordinates come together into infinity, forming symmetrical number space to finite coordinates of Ponegator (tool used to do ponegative operations – I call my brain tool such way, which I have designed from operations, which I can do mentally).

Still, also the Ponegation itself is connected to infinity – connected to number space. I use them separately to emphasize such connections between operations.

I think that in middle of Absolute Time, the men move to infinity position and women to finity, but the base logic frequency remains to same dimension – their expressed dimension has all the operations shared in the same way, but actually the energy fields change so that men actually living in this time start to do infinity, and women the finity operations – in language, abstracts and communication/words, they still use them in old way, women use infinities and men use finities. Logic is science of finities, whereas mathematics is about infinities. Women used to live in future dimension, coming from future or moving more intuitively, men the opposite – I think this is growing together into more complex fractal, where the men start to see things from the polarity of future, math and infinity, and women from perspective of past, logic and finity. Their old powers,

still, remain intact – this is about the aspects, which grow after passing the absolute Zero of time, or the center of it. This turns the spatial axe into inverse, but does not touch the theoretical axe. These are the new, big over-infinity numbers people start to feel, whereas the old numbers do not fall away, the men have same amount of Logic, slowly growing, and the Women have same amount of Mathematics, slowly growing (even the growth speed remains, or only grows); still, the new forces more powerful than this are growing the opposite dimension. I think this is the change of this period, but these are my most direct senses I like to doubt a little, and has not reached any absolute logic or very strong and basic reasoning.

**And – on the sickness of Positive Affirmations**

I am not arguing here, against the healthy spirituality or the Buddhist doctrines; still, I think we can see them in more complex vision through avoiding the dangers. I’m against the Posetive Attitude, but with only Yes and No, it often merges seamlessly into the Positive Attitude, not using the Negative Energy, but treating it as Negotive. With Four Logic Values, where there can be too positive or not too negative, where the actual value can be even opposite to the operation as you consider it or as it has effects in the reality, you need to extend your logical thinking to understand this really – in real world of psychology, there are important things going on in our lives and our minds, where the negative really has to react somehow, to undo itself. If you say “I don’t think Negative Thoughts” or “I say only Yes”, then you either mean an important Spiritual or

Psychological Value, or you mean it’s Posetive counterpart. In the processes of Society, you need to see the Posetive, which often completely blocks the Position.

**Positive Affirmations in Society**

The Success-based society, which measures things based on success, is not merely bad, because we need to protect the weaker. It’s also a failure, because we need to protect the Negative values.

Negative Force fuels healthy relations, social positions, life values and desires into lower, negotive values; this leaves empty periods into our lives, and the materialization of this emptiness is hard to achieve – in this, maybe, if “skeptical” spiritual people, who like to doubt or enjoy the

multipossibility of values, of searching the first-hand experience on the basis of their truth, instead of dogma and authority; these people would probably need religion-free temples and monasteries, with different degrees of freedoms or responsibilities they still believe are for them at this time. By rendering the old positive values into empty, meaningless values by the new standards of soul, the Negative Force guides us to be burnt and then, reborn again, like Phoenix. As the Negative Values develop, or the culture supports it more, the transitions can probably be more seamless. Also, the Negative Values apply often to the ones, who do not support the Positive Values, somehow – then, also, they lose the negative dimension, in infinities through the operations, they suddenly means a normal position costs more than it earns.

Positive Affirmations, on the other hand, can fuel such things:

- It’s healthy and overcomes certain problems to not fall into self-worthlessness; in Buddhism it’s a perfectly aspected and important thing. But, the E-value, Posetive or exceed of such value happens, and introduces the following, common traits in our World right now:

◦Posetive Self-Affirmations: You avoid doing corrections, seeing bad in yourself. In case you see the bad, it’s on the way of removal; when you don’t, it’s on the way of non-

development, which, in infinity, is equal to Negotive, to minus value (I use the word “sinus” for positive minus, or negation). Positive ones, or the ones not in extreme: You avoid hurting yourself with your value being less than optimum; you find a stable way of growth, but you also spend time to values actually appearing, but never reaching the infinity – always, as time moves on, you need to start seeing them as Posetions again, or as you get an opportunity. Negative values: Often, you have the opportunity, but you need to go through the *experience*. Then, you don’t help yourself to heal the negative value in your thought, and resultatively in your environment. As Negative values grow, they become more into potentials – as you vibrate the values in the potential field, the reality aligns into transcending those negative dimensions. The values become Negotive if it’s too early to transcend them – you have to go through (almost) all the past; it’s always the past towards some ideal, and there is always the future when, we would see the present creatures like this as criminally stupid. In Posetive self-affirmations, one becomes painful to critics, he does not want to change. We can see that this is the reason for dogmatism, and it appears throughout religion and the science, even throughout the possible future improvement over them – only active, everlasting and repeated

confirmation can avoid this, and for every person, it uses their best understanding, intuition, and taking care of the cases in which the understanding or intuition is wrong, or the other person needs their experience (Negation) or different Perspective, where their Simplest Model is different – still resulting in Life, which we can appreciate.

◦Posetive group-affirmations or gruposuggestions: Can make the group contra-

revolutionary, dogmatic, stagnant, etc. It protects it’s past predictions and views, the established truth, even truth about diversity of truth (not letting people express clearly about their convictions, and leave room for discussion and agreement). They can create an image of themselves, or their success; also they create the image of themselves, and this image is based mostly on position – it’s a posetive value of different ideals, and it’s clinging to the existing image or attributions. Somehow, this reaches to common pain body towards noticing, when the ideas or actions have been taken off-track. This creates protective circles of thinking, which attack the people, who see them as mistaken, or the evolved truth as opposing to theirs. Large groups in the history tend to fight against older such mistakes, but still, over centuries, do this mistake themselves – the evolution of the culture still, fights those cultures so that more evolved culture is born, and slowly replaces the older one; in past those events tended to be more violent, over time the revolutionary effect becomes more peaceful – the rules, laws and traditions evolve, and the new systems are incorporating revolution, like democracy pretends to be (but with technology, we can more or less easily get further in the combination of freedom and responsibility, allowing more diversity in how the power and taxes are divided, so that your own decisions are directed more towards you and this is not an overload of information or papers, but only a task for a computer or AI). All this resistance to revolution is posetive group-affirmation.

◦The case that the science, government, and organizations do not let the revolutionary thinkers in, or the ones, who are constantly changing – each generation of thought, different values are still becoming dogmatic, even if they were designed to fight dogmas in the old. As more people learn the culture, and they understand the reasons and deep thinking behind those things less, and tend to close the uncertainties with false-

certainties or the neutons with posetons (my math described in the part you might not read to still understand this part); they do positive self-affirmations and becoming sure on how they deserve, they become protective to their established routines of truth. In case the truth is questionable, it’s normal to have different people preferring different aspects, and going through different periods – often, even their ideal positions don’t fit to each other, because the simplicity of their models is still verified to create wholes in the meaningful, measured and more or less proven parts of their theory, and the risks of being wrong are somehow handled. In many questions, like about the nature of the soul, you simply see different planes or paradigms, still disagreeing – working with such part towards clarity is the common objective, but people with different sides can have solid working concept of the world, for example a person, who does not believe in God, or doubts, might still do God, and that even in potential case, when God exists. The same applies to person, who believes in Karma, from the viewpoint of unethicalness of Karma– I consider this wrong, but they cannot say you won’t behave sincerely just because you believe in Law of Karma. Still, in another time, those people who see such problems, might attribute the common mistakes you do or they are unable to avoid, when

conceptualizing about Karma, or the causalities in their lives, which really don’t work.

Rather, I think, the theorems of both sides can be true, like the concept of God can be used for manipulation, and for many people, is not healthy – the conceptualization of Buddha seems to fit this position, that God, if He exists, might be misunderstood and this could become criminal misunderstanding. Also I agree that it’s not only a person’s own fault if they have bad Karma – some people, again very positive people, who measure things based on position or posetion, they think people are guilty for what happens to them, or that they have to be punished; making things worse and thus creating the closed circle. This attitude, however, does not grow out from how I see the Karma – I see it as being deeper, and it’s effects playing far more complex game than the Yes-game, where Yes is never Posetive, and No is never Negative (in my logecs, these are the values of being true despite of being wrong, and being wrong despite of being true; thing may appear in thoughts, calculations and reality, in order to undo itself, or provide some other kind of experience – the logic of experience is not the logic of direct truth, or rather the position-posetion union or completely *positive attitude*). I think many people see no paradox in their positive attitude – when you find the positive in the end of every experience, there is an ever-lasting effect that some experiences never end, and more and more higher planes still meed with their own posetives and negatives; in avoidance of negative feeling – higher and higher realities become empty and

meaningless, unless they evolve with you; and in case they evolve with you – by more free flow of people in companies, religions, countries, the realities of them are in permanent rebirth, and this the principle of Matter of Impermanence, of flow of this components through the forms, and repetition of patterns of forms. Reincarnation itself can be seen as pattern of you existing being repeated in the fractal of infinity, with the reasons to exist probably remaining quite stable for most of the people – I believe, the basic reasons for every person to exist, even in improved form, is eternal and ever-repeating, even as new species evolve. The new personality identifies themselves with the old, but the old might not always think it’s completely the new – the new has growth of the same basic attributes, growth also of the growing diversity of it’s attributes, as this diversity itself is a positive attribute. So the reality must remember itself again and again

in the same situation, as it’s memory grows together, it remembers them as the same persons – as the fractal repeats, the experiences of the same person also repeat; and as they are healed, they heal in the whole fractal and it’s consciousness. By their Causality, which, in it’s Yin aspect can be seen as perceiver himself or herself, the fractal parts come together again – it creates the perception of I again, which is part of perception of the Whole. In some sense, extreme yin, there is only on Perceiver – the Law of

Perception itself as it’s occuring in the Matter and in the Structure. The law of Causality is equally direct and strong for the structure, even over Time and Space (in it’s Yang) aspect, as it’s direct and strong for the Elements, or the Simpler Laws of Locality and Greater Space. The complex structures follow Laws, which are as direct and real, and as strongly having the senses, as the more elementary Laws covering the microparticles or celestial bodies. The Law and the Imperfection of the Yin cause the Pain and the Pleasure, either felt or, potentially (but we don’t know) unfelt. I think the basic

properties of feeling appear in any causality, but in higher one we call life – it unites the infinities of reality and potential. The direct impossibilities in the future affect the past; the Light senses it’s future – but so does the Light in the Mind, or it’s not the Light; it’s maybe simply because the Light *needs to*, in the end. In Evolution, as well, always the Better wins (and the word “good” has at least three distinct meanings, which I unite into one concept, in the play of Four Truth Values of my logic). As in the fractal, our pattern and the I-sense reappears, so do we get back to our senses; as our Cause is eternally active force, meanwhile, we feel our deeper meaning and purpose, which is the Force creating us again – the Force of Stability keeps us together meanwhile, when this Force or direct Cause of the Cause is not giving birth to us. Gaining back our past experience is more complex – the Ultimate Perceiver slowly associates itself with it’s past feelings, and in Cosmic Consciousness, our memories about the past are reawaken.

◦Positivity about the Tax Money – dogmatic skeptics and atheists, now, but before, for example, the dogmatic Christians, run around the positive qualities of money and power.

We all pay the taxes, but they do not reach the goals of us all, also in spiritual

development. This creates the loan the atheists should pay, revitalizing the Spiritual Collective and giving back the material values they have earned. Tax money is supposed to only go to the positive goal, but it also goes to help the different people to unite, and to have the governmental support, and to support the businesses, which bring them their values. In democracy and capitalism, it cannot be another way – computers and the AI, working with mass information, can make this tax money very personal, diverse, and this is the base value of capitalism and democracy.

◦Success-based measurement. “Success” can either avoid the Negotive and Posetive, following the Negative and Positive – in my logic, this means, it can either include all our Dark Nights – or it might solely be defined as Positive value. Humans are pressed to follow those values, and then, the good affirmations are on their way. Their mental health might be measured by these values, and their stories might be rewritten and hallucinated together by other people, as if those were supposed to be only positive values. On the same time, the real energy is change – the change is negative value, as it destroys the boundaries, the friendships, the social spheres, it moves people from one company to another, or provides us with the feeling of meaninglessness in life. The feeling is always growing – in balance, we have to enjoy what we have as we never have

the ideal, but we have to go further, either together or leaving others, as new ideals appear and the feelings of depression start to disconnect us from the values as they are. This is an ever-lasting process, movement in the material world, where the matter flows into the form and out from the forms, and the same forms appear in different places in different shapes, and degrees of development. People do not need to run into the best forms and be very positive, but they slowly progress through different forms and create better-resonating coaligning force with some forms; some people find the Buddhist model better-fit for their life, some find the Christian model – those two, for example, might disagree in the reincarnation concept, but they generally agree that the same type of True actions bring them better results, their models are somehow fully functional. I personally believe that Christian model is simplified, and the Buddhist model better reflects the Fractal of Space, Time and Reasoning, where the Christian model sees only a single instance of every direction; in Buddhism, you flow smoothly from Earth to Heavens or Hells, whereas in Christianity, you go there very sharply and without recurring fractal; in Buddhism, there exist gradual dimensions, where in Christianity, there exists only the Center, and two Polar Extremes. In Chinese Taoism and

Confucianism, such polarities and two-fold centers are used polarly, but this polarity is only metaphorical and used for symbolization or simplification – the Chakras, where Christians mostly have polarity of Body and Mind, the Buddhists see seven or a different number of degrees from one to another. As you reason to the end, in practical causalities, your view is not very different – and Buddhist would agree, that exactly in the same shape you are probably born one time, and I would add, this feeling or I-sense would probably go directly to heaven or hell, I think you can draw such straight lines into personality of being. Religions, in general, agree that the Causality of Law of Karma can happen beyond the physical form, which is the most important implication – I think, it manipulates me to think that the implications of my life need to be bigger for rational and self-loving attitude, and by atheism, there is no reason why they should not – for society, it’s good in all cases. I think in deeper values, the simpler or more advanced system do not contradict – by Newtonian calculations and Quantum Physics, where they both apply in our lives, and that’s a lot, you reach very similar practical applications, but with different degrees of simplicity. In life model, there are a few important differences – for example, Good and Evil are more important in Christianity, but also together with Forgiveness and Understanding. About success-based reasoning – our social class, or psychological condition, it cannot only be determined by how much we say “yes”.

◦Opportunities in success-based society. Much of the development of society has been coming from people, who gave something away – monks give a lot away, and they have been the driving force of development of civilization in some stages; if you don’t run for positive values like power and money, but you also go through stress and revitalization; also you spend time seeking the Truth and choosing a correct position – as you go through negative states of mind, your life can also go through negative states. But those are not negotive. Those can be heavy and hard, but they are the experiences for finding the better ways, and also becoming immune to the worst, but somehow transcending it.

Partially, they are important because you give away the old to gain the new, and partially, because they undo yourself – as you give away the values, you get the experience to get back the deeper values under those values; your negation becomes

more seamless, the growth less painful, the pain of giving the birth is easier to overcome. But to confront the basic forces needed for that – you have to give away guarantees, old habits, you have to find time, and finally, if it’s not working at all, you also give it away.

It’s not because you lost it – but you have to go through feelings of loss –, but it’s because they became depleted ..such kind of stress creates the structure of society, which is growing. For people, who don’t go through such changes – they social structure becomes like a dogma, standing there without any reason, becoming only a sensory pleasure for them, something senses, but not there. This I call a posetive. The pain, which makes you change, and give away – it must be constantly growing and growing in society, so that even the highest values are eventually revisioned as low values or even sins and crimes; all our self-protection, in terms of future, can be violent as we could do much better. We can see ancient tribes consisting of criminals in todays terms – but they followed their Gods and Ideals very keenly.

◦Posetive perception – this is when somebody rewrites your life story as if you were stuck in the paradox you overcame, or as if you was seeking or supposed to seek only the positive values. Still, to be healthy, you go through pain, through the pain of your current state, and through the transitions, which clean you in the middle – from friends, from jobs, from static thought patterns. In time, those transitions become more seamless, but they don’t go away, and from those higher states they seem almost the same – in time, you become stronger about them, you go through them calmly, and you also do not lose the base values so much; but the transitions with their whole experience are really important, and I think when you seek new meaning – you don’t care about things you used to call success. The society is fueled by such process, and for many people it’s most effective to be alone, in monastery-like settings maybe, living like a monk. Today, for people generally spiritual, but not exactly christian or buddhist or of other well-

established religion – this is the type of skeptical searcher, who does not know their religion for sure, or has very personal philosophy grown from their own clarity; if you can seek your own Truth, and this becomes enlightened, in Buddhism you would be Buddha – if you can do more of it, it’s positive. In modern days, it’s more and more important for everybody to be more directly acquainted with Truth, and this was heavily empathized in Scientific Revolution – and, it’s really important in Spirituality as well, especially in Buddhism, where you are then called Buddha and can be an original teacher of enlightened person; otherwise, your teaching is not so strong to make you a Teacher. Thus, in it’s essence, Buddhism emphasizes original Truth, an own story. It also tells about God that you cannot be very clear about the implication of this topic, so you are not directly told whether God exists or not – rather, you might think it exists, but it’s more like Synchronicity than entity, compared to your belief; or you do not believe in God, but the reality is still more in Union and Oneness than you think; by looking at all those things – in Buddhism, in experience, you can know the existence or non-existence of God. I like to argue about this topic, but I generally agree this might the best starting point – with concept so complicated, you can be in very different position; but you cannot say the stories of God are not meaningful and do not express an important archetype. When God is born, I think peace is needed – how can different thinkers create a safe structure? Has God, in these days, the responsibility to be completely anonymous? I think the answer in Buddhism, that they generally respect each other’s Gods.

◦Posetive attitude in avoidance of visibility of weakness – we need to know each others weakness, so that we can form a society; this is a mathematical fact. Who does not, is bound to die. Still, representations of politicians, goods, companies – they all hide the imperfections. If we don’t do this, we lose nothing but an illusion, but we win a whole development. In turn, we cannot show those mistakes, because positive people are going to attack us and they can become violent, especially mentally violent – they give us the feeling of failure, suspect us being crazy, etc., simply because our ways are not the simple “yeses”. Sure, should we find our ways, they want all the positive things, and they think they were helping us. Such person, even on street, tries to use signals as if they were important and useful for you, be those true or false; thus their society-protection and money-sharing signals simply provide them those things, the positive qualities they can arrive at. This is the self-image, and even psychologically or mentally, you rob others if you have such picture.

◦Academic circles can see themselves as good, and thus they say who have different ways to learn, do not get what they get. Still they produce people, who have later “forgotten” what they learnt, and think that those are better than the ones, who did not forget what they learnt on their own. You can see also the officials making mistakes, but then becoming overly positive about the mistakes – they protect them to the end, do not fix or pay back, and do not hear, once the mistake is done. They would show undeveloped patterns of accusing, and destroy themselves, as they can see their mistakes, and thus they repeat them over. Once learnt a science, they become dogmatic, and support only the well-established past philosophies, even when the creative minds have already gone further.

◦In friend circles, they want to see good in the people and the relations, and once you was treated less good than you do yourself, however evolved you have this property, or once you see the weakness or area to be made better – you break their visions, for example being an academic or a good official, and thus, they would want to fight with you.

Revolutionary person fuels the society by always seeing the mistakes, even in higher stages he or they are able to reach.

◦If you are creative, positive people can be very jealous, as this does not help them with their affirmations and images; they do not want to see people much better than themselves, and this effect is there in disgustingly many aspects.

◦*Conspiracy of Positive Thinking*: as they finish the friendship, they are not going to tell you. Sometimes you can have a long argue, where they say they indeed want to be your friend, and come against your gut feeling. Because you yourself do not want to betray this friend, you remain close with your gut feeling. But then, they make up a grand theme made from only the “yes” facts, which finally solve as “no” for you. The same way, they push you out of social circle – often, in positive thought, any negative thing forms as conspiracy and you cannot have your word or argument; until the end, they avoid any sign of what they are saying about you, but they definitely do. This is because the negative argument itself is pain for them. Initially, you might accuse, because you can see you are useful for them – so the avoidance of argument is somewhat reasoned. In the end they are straight mad, because what you want is to get rid of such people in your life as soon as possible, and you have learnt not to want a long argument. In a form of

conspiracy, they can also have their hidden will of still having position in your life, and deduce your friends away. So you cannot make your friendship straight and honest, and this is the conspiracy of positive thinking – how and when, in the hell, did they start to think that spiritual people in general should be accused in this or that, when all of them pretended to be best friends of them? You haven’t had these arguments. Often, you cannot point out their mistakes, because this would be seen as a sign that you reached to conclusion of your mistake yourself – mad and distorted version of testing you.

◦*Effect of Advertisement*: Positive thinkers paint as good picture of themselves as they can, arguing that if they don’t manage to be that, at least they manage to play that role in society. For such an extrovert nature, role in society is as good as truth itself, nothing is missing. They also want such friends and so, they all protect each others from being “accused” of not really being more than a role; for example they finish the work with help of friends, but pretend that they know all of this themselves. They also accuse you in mistakes you don’t do, because part of thinking positively of themselves is that they are better than you; and this is implied – you are worse than them, or more importantly, you are worse than you are. I have learnt to be honest about my mistakes and

weaknesses. Now, I create pictures of me, which empathize also why I’m not the perfect fit to the role, and more importantly I set new goals and thus, always show that my current state is not up to those. Positive thinker would argue that you need to always want what you get, and if you want more than you get, you have a failure of will, being not fit to society; also that this image you created yourself, and thus you are to be blamed – by law of attraction (even atheists use it somehow, in their self-affirmations and business strategies) you project bad image of you; they can tell you “at least you need to lie to me” (that you go to doctor and thus won’t come to work, or that you had other serious reasons). My bad projection is entirely made up, and this should produce a social effect that others are involved in creating a realistic picture and contributing to development and growth – in case I would try to leave a perfect impression, that would not be the case. Now, me with my realistic image of myself, my company, my goods, if I would be a politician – my politics and the strength or weakness of knowledge behind that; or in any case, am I really up to the role ..people less capable than me, by creating perfect images out of nothing – they could be far better fit than me, helping the company achieve it’s perfect image. So the ego problem gets to next level – a company, a social circle. As the social circle or company also wants a perfect image, they rather do not mind that they are being lied, but they appreciate this as they really want this false image to be big. They do not want to tell you that they failed to make their new product ecological, and from their advertisement woman, you cannot see in her face that their products lack *anything*. These things are also empowered by other positive people – who accuse everybody, who fails with their positive image. These accusations, as healthy accusing of a friend in order to make them better, is completely unnatural to them, is painful, aggressive, dangerous and really unhealthy and sick thing. Their voices get out of order, and civilized manners are heavily penalized. In case you are used to people showing their weakness, and happy that they warned you about all potential problems – you work through this constructively, and take care that at least some people should have some of the strengths you need, and that the outcomes, which are not completely ideal, are expected. Your clients or voters won’t pretend to expect perfect outcomes, but work

realistically through what they have, and would not believe the people, who still pretend to be perfect. The ability to see the mistakes in yourself and others – would be seen as a seed for growth. This is a negative energy, which is used to fuel through the weakness into the strength; in this way, only positive people would become dogmatic – as they won’t accuse themselves in weakness of their thought –, stagnated, rigid and unable to change or grow – I think the whole Soviet Union failed when such things started to happen.

◦Being positive about the Money, Power, Success – many people assume that all those things are always in the right place. So, when your strategy is not to achieve all this as soon as possible, and this strategy rather fails, then you work right into being accused. But first, the good things might not always be good in any situation; and second, they are not going to right places at all – there is Law of Karma, but this is far more complex thing than simply a force giving you the money you deserve for your work; even if you work hard to also help others, and those people are starting their way maybe from even less than you, you are not using all your time to help yourself. You don’t have time to always help yourself – you help many things, and you manage your time. Positive person would tell you that by all means, you have to have helped yourself, and helped yourself completely out – things that can happen to them, in which cases they sometimes help, they are a few things; things, which can happen to a person, who is not dedicated to only their own success – they are many, you actually balance whether you deserve it or others should get their part, whether you really need it or you should look for a deeper goal, etc.

**What you can do to fight those values?**

You have to recreate your social structure, and I think we have to create the tax system and business environment, where different parts of society can express their models, cosmologies, and roles or life phases – for Spiritual People, there is a great need to protect their own Scientists, Doctors, and Businesses, and to fight for their balance of taxes, and the social opportunities. It’s said that neutral truth is used to balance these things, and tax payers and resources exist as single entities, which need to follow the Truth; but in reality – we need to see that different groups must be able to go in the ways they enjoy; and the spiritual people, for example, cannot be said to do it in unhealthy, unbalanced or environmentally careless way – the Model is different, but the results can not be criticized. They can also rightfully want to know about their science branches, failures and successes, and the long, deep philosophy and work to test their hypothesis.

I think important parts are:

- To see the friend base, which is pushing to “yes” values, as meaningless, which does not let you be happy about yourself. Let go of positive values you sought with your friends, things you were waiting to appreciate each others; also the wider circles, which are not friends – but people you use to relate you. You need people who you can really serve, with what you really are, and who can live with the stages and paths of people like you. The success-based society, you have to give it away by yourself – then, find the friends and supporters who share your values and do not demand what you can not offer; who do not wait until you reach those. The society you have needs to be here and now, and you combine most of it – but you also need to be sure we become collectively strong so that spirituality is well-

supported by taxes we pay, and the psychologist of atheist is not paid by spiritual person, who pays for chakra work himself, or the science not discussing spiritual ideas and not taking the effort to research it’s hypothesis, is supported by a person, who really learns from people, who do the spiritual work – which he, hopefully, somehow pays.

- The companies, which can afford only the perfect life stories, you have to let go of their success mentality, and connect you with different circle. To connect, also, means to do that on potential field – you have to inspire people to become one, in case they are stuck in the same situation. It’s not very probable that this is not a common problem for many people. I personally am more perfectionist than I can be, and I used to like to go through long searches, and accept less – now I can see my personality, to be really useful I need people, who are much less demanding with standard success; I actually think I am healing of this Dark Night, but really – my signs try to support people, who expect me to become a part of what I don’t want to become a part of; a company, where I have to hide my spiritual ideas to sound as if I share their ideals. I am changing to not see those people as part of my life – and positive thinking connects all those people; my reasoning is contradictory with this. In my attitude, I have many things I want to keep – like being open to show my mistakes; but this is not the attribute of image-creation of success-based society, which wants to create and see the false images.
- This is the general term where Buddhism can come into play – the life in Here and Now. At least this is my current solution – I think something like this exists in other religions, but I’m not yet there to be general :) These are the positive qualities of Buddhism ..I think, from Buddhism you find out that you have to accept those very people, who appreciate your qualities and get something from them, and you need to meditate on the strong blocks you feel about why your root chakra is not so open, or why you cannot connect to the society you want to live in – you have some blocks, which make your material ideas posetive, unachievable. These are your own positive thoughts. You need to calmly decide to allow yourself a good material life even if those weaknesses exist, and thus you need to connect with people, which can also see such weaknesses in themselves, or who still find you useful in case you have them. I saw that in my mind, what I need to earn money, I had set up a completely impossible scheme – requirements, which, I can find out, I have established myself with my psychological magic; namely, I block myself where I don’t “deserve”. Here you can see how the positive thinking helps against positive thinking! What I described, is the positive thinking we see in many cases – that if your life is not so positive, you have bad karma, and the person you meet, indeed, has to develop this bad karma further. This is very positive. But that you want to live through your weakness and not-yet-thereness, this is very real. I suggest you stop creating the images of the future, meant to help you in the society – and you need to seek for more natural self-presentation, which wants to get everything done, but without such expectations. Thus, you need to create circle, which is not that positive, and which, maybe, is itself experiencing all the Negative Force of Changing, but it’s getting so much back from it that it’s also compensating it and not expecting too much. I surely doubt that your limits are your own magic – you might have too high expectations of “how society works” and you can not see how much can be achieved in modern world with reasonably little effort; the people, who want to get higher and do not accept you unless you do – they might look cooler, especially the happy few they have selected to reflect the success, but you need to become very natural with what you are and how the network makes

people like you stronger, providing you your needs with modest outcomes and all the free time to meditate and work with yourself, also the free time to find simpler, more cost-efficient solutions, finally still solving the value-creation with less effort; societies like that develop much faster, and thus we need those “negative” values. I can see positive people follow their positive values very directly and they want to know every reason for a negative aspect – but there is such an abundance of those reasons, that negativity itself is almost completely reasoning itself in many cases; you need to be modest in your effort, but still not block the values you still create. I see that material world is mostly about moderation, and there can be too positive view on both spending and incomes – both can be imagined to be better than needed.

This is maybe a story of how my life made you appreciate the Buddhist ideas – surely, with my own inspiration, development of ideas and direct visions of Truth, which make me a skeptical thinker or perceiver, even my intuition trying to go deeper :) Negative thought itself is doing that; I have a lot of insight to see the truth – but I still always want it to grow stronger ..but I can see the way of Buddha is not so easily ending :) Even if now, I can see why to fight the restlessness and sensory desires – when those go away, it’s like Buddhism getting to end (but Buddha told that in the higher skies, you finally find new things to follow, to reach even much higher). I don’t know why I suddenly see those things, is this the beginning or end :) I can see that the sensory desires – as you cling to the affirmation that this is the truth, instead of truth itself, you are clinging to sensory desire of the Truth, instead of real desire. This is how I see the meaning of this now, and it makes sense.

Also, when I walk the negation – I also see the strong truth that the positive has to be achieved in my soul, to reach the enlightenment; but I also doubt that the way ever ends ..I think on the way, it’s natural and necessary, to work through the negative on more and more subtle level, and never start to think ***you must not even think of it*** or fall into so low that you **do not enjoy the negative thought about yourself or your social structure or belief** – you don’t know, where those lead, but rather your life is then growing itself, not only the thought and projection. This is true that you project your negative thoughts, and with negative thoughts, in many ways you go though the negative things – but the Logec of Positive and Negative coexisting is so strong, so permanent and visible everywhere, that you cannot say it’s not part of the Eternal Truth. You cannot say “Yes” is the absolute Truth – the Truth, it sees Yes and No, but it goes through a complex pattern of them, where Truth is about to become, but force of the False is there to find a realistic pattern of disappearance, instead of mere projection – which might help you for a while, but is really fragile. So as I see deep danger if I lack positive thought – I see deep danger if I lack negative thought. To some degree, this paradox is negative, but you need it until you solve it. As you vibrate all the Truth values in Reality and people’s minds, who do not get insulted by negatives, the Truth becomes Stronger – ***the Reality, once it perceives the difference, still grows in Positive Direction***.
