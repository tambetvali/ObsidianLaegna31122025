**Meditation and Transmutation of Pain**

**Four letters of Logec**

I use e instead of i (in the word Logec) for my four-letter system – to say it’s a bigger one (Logec

also takes infinities into account, which Logic does not – thus the e instead of i). Don’t read this

part if you want directly the meditations, and not the math and logic part.

*Positive Thinking* is an affirmation, which is supposed to avoid pain to the end. This progress, anyway, cannot be a first degree integral (acceleration), a direct force – it must be an indirect force, a second degree integral (acceleration of acceleration). Directly, we must face the pain.

Carl Custav Jung once stated that negative emotions are important part of our harmonics, the whole of all frequencies. We cannot underestimate the pain.

I use four letters to describe Truth Values, usually described by two – True and False. I use the letter R for the space or axes, degrees of infinity, and the letter T for local value, degree of locality.

I use the following letters (the R significying, whether it is on the Axe, true also in infinity, and T significying, whether it’s true or false, locally):

- I (Negotion) – it’s False, which is also considered False.
- O (Negation) – it’s False, but considered True, because it helps us in infinity (or larger scale – my use of word infinity is inseparable for deep logical reasons I describe later in another text).
- U – it’s either Zero between them (any of four values under zero, or thus their center value); half octaves (I measure big and small octaves – it’s a length of size, which makes the number inversed) up it’s A or O – an open value, which I often use; or it’s the positive uplifting of reality. I always use the same letters, but they have different positions for the task – these are easy to remember letters, once you get used with it.
- A (Position) – it’s True, and considered True.
- E (Posetion) – it’s True, but considered False.
- Upside-down-U – it’s either point between I and E, but with their angle – when U is between them in sharp angle, this letter is in infinitely many infinitely small angles, which makes it another angle; or it’s where the wheel of numbers ends at infinity and starts again at minus infinity (often, it’s both two at the same time, but this latter one inversed); or it’s a negative shift of reality down – where the current base logic is replaced with the new one, or a base situation, but this transformation is negative.

Imagine the temperature: killing cold is I, health-growing cold (like shower with a cold water) is O, pleasurable temperature is A and killing hot, fire burning, is E. U can be when you tolerate it, but cannot say whether it’s hot or cold; and V (upside-down-U) is connecting the killing element of too hot and too cold into one conception.

E is also when you get it too soon, or when it’s a good start, but failure at the end. Sometimes I use E for something in the future you want to get – it’s a growth, but you cannot achieve it now; for such case, E is on positive axe and thus it needs to be worked through. I is the same – you have to raise your toleration levels, and by going through your I values, you grow stronger. I use words sine for such negative values, cosine for such positive values, and cone for currently holding correct truth value.

In some cases I use 1, 2, 3, 4 for i, o, a, e; and 5, 6, 7, 8 for I, O, A, E or actually for their inverse axes – then, it means you are on the axe, where your posetion and negotion become True again, and your position and negation become false again. 0 and 9 are in places of U and V for whole axes, and sometimes you need several-digits values for them. Still, there are only some hard cases, where I need to use 8 values and their combinations, or numbers made up by those values – and I can express it also with 4; 4 values themselves are not expressible by 2 values, True and False – they are not topologically the same (only by using infinity-large numbers can you do that).

Sine:

- You avoid this, but you develop a function, which let’s you go through this, either directly or

for example, facing it in your mind.

- You never want it to be completely true, but you want it’s transforming effect on you. In one

way or another, you face all the negative values, growing *deeper*.

Cone:

- This is what you usually want to will – it’s a realistic, positive will; a positive thinking. It

can also contain the training, work and other O values, which can be directly spending the

energy, but indirectly achieving it (in terms of using your energy and time, not gaining it

directly, it’s O and not A value, Negation and not Position).

Cosine:

- If you become too optimistic, you won’t achieve your goals, and when you become

Posetion, your deeper reason, which needs you, become Negotion.

I call this four-letter system (and I always say four, despite that I can use 2, 4 or 6 letters, or even

more).

**My meditation**

I started with Zen:

- First months I used 5 minute times for walking to shop and back, when I was a child, 10 yrs

old, to watch my breathing and concentrate on that, so that this focus makes the rest of my

brain empty.

- One I was able to focus in such way, I stopped watching my breath, and simply left the brain

empty – which one was the goal. Once you concentrate on your breath, you cannot think in

the same time by words.

This Emptiness is the Source of Energy and Inspiration. Your mind gets kind of balanced in infinity,

and you get energy and inspiration flow, sometimes a few ideas by second – otherwise, you invent

them long. The emptiness, like the watching-the-breathing was transformed to Void, is transformed

into Attention – this very same emptiness, or the experience you learn from that general focus, you

can once again gather together and focus on one area. This is called Attention in meditation – it fills

this are with, of course, energy and inspiration.

You can focus on anything you want, but the following are basic things to focus:

- Your body. Focus on part of your body makes it conscious and stronger, more immune.
- Your feelings. They also bring you important information, as every feeling is reflection of

something real.

- Your thoughts.

You can also, becoming more advanced, focus on:

- The society.
- The material and living beings around you as you walk.

When you get stuck in the concrete things, you focus on them and transcend them. Your energy,

either inside or outside, will transcend the thing you focus on, or the method to use to cope with it.

It becomes in more and more advanced dimensions, and first you cannot grasp these dimensions –

there are complex techniques for this.

Non-focus is bigger force than focus, so once your have done your local things, you want to practice emptiness further. Meditation, generally, is either focus or non-focus, for example visualization of concrete things or not visualizing at all. You can kind of imagine, that focus on a part is like mundane activity, similar to root chakra activity, and no-focus or focus on a whole (this is the same) is like heavenly activity, similar to crown chakra function.

In all the process, you transcend the reality, but much more you transcend yourself and your actions – like you are an object for your mind, you don’t even notice how you do things in better way, you use magic on yourself – they are not conscious actions, but the ones you do about things you meditated about, can be surprising, very fast and behave like butterfly effect (used in subconscious magic as well – but spirituality is not occultism, in sense that we don’t want to *control the matter* in desired direction, but we want a *better interflow*, to release tensions we have with matter – so that we become more on with it; it’s not getting over the Laws of Nature, but rather uplifting force, which makes the matter use, in regard to us, the Higher Law – whereas occultism, if you seek mere control, can make you follow the Lower Law, cause things, which the matter does not like).

**Positive Thinking**

Here I use the letters A and E in different way – A, if it only hold now, and E, if it also holds in the future. In all cases, E is more positive, but often unachievable, for example if a person wants you to follow their math, but is making mistakes you want – it’s their E letter, trying to be better, not worse; still, they can completely break what you do. And as it’s E, you don’t know how to say no – you would hurt their deep feelings about themselves, not the evil will against you. I sometimes use A and O letters for positive and negative thing, and I and E letters to show whether they turn negative or positive in the future, or in relation to the past, or even by the very next calculation (outside the scope of this calculation). I call this an infinity-property that you cannot measure them well in relation to current calculation; maybe, I and E are whether it’s for general good or bad.

Positive thinking, you should not use directly:

- When you concentrate on a positive aspect, ignoring negative, the latter becomes subconscious, and you are not aware of it’s reason. Such case, the negative is bound to constantly annoy you and it tries to come back.

Thus, the better way (I call this Sinus – the curve down and back up, O and E):

- You concentrate on your negative aspects, and you *bring light* to that parts of you.
- You have Awareness in this part of you, let’s call it deeper, because mere positive thinking is shallow – it creates a kind of false smile you cannot get rid of.
- This brings you pain, and it has effects on reality – your reality becomes worse. But who said that worse is always worse. This said, you measure, how much you can tolerate – a five-minute work or years in struggle.
- You make yourself more sensitive to your pain, so that even a discomfort becomes painful.

As pain is bad for your health, you need to be very careful, that you don’t break it – you should only put it under some stress. So there are distances you don’t want to go into (let’s call them I-distances) – you need an O value, negation, not a negotion. So you create pain you can later heal. You are interested in pain about things, which can, for example, be so

general and overwhelming that you cannot even think they are problems – for example, things in society you never thought you could change, or mental or physical law, which seems absolute.

- You let the pain grow, but watch carefully that you don’t exceed your tolerance – what happens, would be real and serious, as this is the mind magic. But you don’t care for some outside effects; in some cases, you want to have a period of being a monk without money and social guarantees – in other cases, you just want a little work with these things.
- In your life, you don’t need false friends. You give people some little chance to do bad to you, and by this you grow – finally, you don’t need to give this chance, but you get more conscious that the bad you are subconsciously avoiding is real and it only needs a chance.

Now, this done – the light in the negative aspect starts to grow.

- Not as an immediate, but as a solution value, positive thinking is true; you are bound not to keep those negative feelings, but you want them to get so much light, that they transform into the same good pattern you get from positive thinking. You have not escaped, but now the negative thought itself has become positive – next time you get this thought, it’s faster transcended, and later, when this bad situation arrives, it does not even reach you; you get *stronger*.
- Negativity, it has a rather good aspect – it becomes real enough to make the base physics of the space understand it does not want it. For example, with fear of death, you let all this magic happen, which kills you – but the space (let’s assume a good karma) does not want you die; so, it goes itself through this, and suddenly your pain dies. Now, the space itself has started to create a *deductive* rule that you wont die – and you don’t have this backhit anymore, that you try to be positive, but you are on more and more shallow ice with this. The negative force is actually a positive one – it gets force itself; this I call Sinus – it’s born in between the numbers and life, it’s non-existent, not real, but it wants good; once you pay attention to negativity in you and your potential – it gets it’s own force to die (such energy wants to die, and it’s clever with it). So you get an evil part of your mind, which plays with you, does tricks with you, but all this to die in a better way.
- As you approach positivity, you get closer to negative thing inevitably, it’s stronger and stronger – somewhere in infinity and your lifetimes it will catch you. Every positive thing has a negative past – one of trial and error.

From the other hand, which is cosine:

- You put some effort also to too-good things, and you always choose a solution, which is not only *more true*, but it’s also *better*. If it’s impossible, finally you make it possible – but the same way, you must do this little by little, as believing too much good can kill you (it’s the E value).

In the end, my mathematics is approaching that it was Positive Thinking – it goes through this transformation, and you are still feared that you haven’t transcended the lower part, but only stick to the higher – the lower part you did not live through, will, one day start living through you, and this is not Sinus, but the actual Sickness, which can be your unturnable reality.
