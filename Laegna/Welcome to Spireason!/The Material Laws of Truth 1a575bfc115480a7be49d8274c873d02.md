# The Material Laws of Truth

**The Material Laws of Truth**

In it’s Yang essence, the Truth is unchanging, final, absolute and fundamental, it’s same for everybody and it’s constantly active in all the things; we can arrive at states of Mind, where it appears so – in those states, we see it’s the valid and perfectly makes sense, everything is in Harmony and that’s it.

From those states, we meet something irrational, something empty – a recurring pattern of Material Reality, which comes to our thoughts and remains with a force as strong; it takes us back to the Earth. Into our recurring problems, into the thoughts we don’t like – into something Negative. This is not really in alignation with our Reason, and it does not seem Metaphysical – but it inevitably comes, each time we reach the Truth. Buddha said everything is impermanent – and, I guess, he also pointed to this yin aspect of Truth. The impermanence, imperfection, incompleteness, it comes back and if it does not seem True, it’s at least undeniable, unavoidable. This is the Material Aspect of Truth, the Negative Aspect. We cannot escape that, as Buddha said, so our nature must rise above that and align with the Processes of Nature, which happen anyway. This Truth in Manifested Form is so strong, so evident in Reality, that we must agree that it must be another Truth – otherwise we are destined to doom.

**Law of Polarity of Truth**

Once we arrive to extreme end to one Truth (and society, in general, reaches those dead ends whichever direction you take), we are also forced to have an opposite Truth – so, as Truth reaches it’s Extreme, it’s replaced by another, conflicting, opposing or contradictionary Truth. New Waves of Light, they always have another, often the opposite message; even if there is the same Truth – Life – underlying them.

For example, in extreme belief of God, our image of God was distorted – the new Truth was that God does not exist; the meaning was corrupt, and pointing to something, which made all the people destructive. The meanings and interpretations change, and the Truth to heal them – it might contradict the Past Truth. Finally, it’s Rhythmically moving around a given point. For some people, it’s True that they only need a prayer and they need to accept the gifts; for other people – they have to take the responsibility and expect nothing from higher forces. The resulting Models, in all the details, are very different and this is more than human can do, to not have many seemingly incoherent aspects of those models.

**The Personal Truth**

At any given point of life, you have your given level of understanding, IQ, senses and different kinds of hypersensory perceptions; you live in a different world. To survive there, you need to create a World Model in your head, and strategies to develop this.

For this reason, we can argue very well about whether something is true or not – there are Truths, Lies, Manipulations, Mistakes etc., and the reasoning exists; we can show that something is proven, not proven or disproven. Still, we do it based on different models, different levels of access to experience, and we need to know that a True Model of the World is also, which works.

So for every person we cannot simply state the same Truth – we must make sure, which is their Situation in Truth, where the Truth is moving around and changing by Material Laws of Truth, and we need to understand their opportunities and limitations; then we can say something useful. We can have arguments, protect certain points and be against others – but what we get, is not something equally suitable for everyone; what we get is that each model is gradually becoming better; some person might be left disappointed when they applied our high Truths, which are True.

Thus, it’s not nice if the Battles around Truth are seen as battles, where one side wins, and the other would lose. In certain playgrounds, like Natural Sciences – sometimes we agree on certain rules, and based on those rules we can have all the debate to find things closer to Truth, by given criteria. In reality in general, this criteria does not exist – if we apply the same scientific principles to some spiritual system, the models are not compatible and the rules would fail; after the argument, a spiritual people knows less and their chances in life are smaller. In Buddhism, we can observe the Mind and following the rules, we reach deeper understanding, but this cannot be applied directly to science – in science, we see, some practices of Buddhism definitely give us some measurable advantages, but the Truth behind those are far from the Scientific Model; usually we cannot speak of Matter and the Mind in same terms – there are no simple models, which would see them as one. We can only see correlations, that if something happens in our mind, there is something happening in matter as well – but we don’t see a solid principle, an unified equation, where we do not need to think and calculate much to get from one to another; Matter and Mind are obviously very different things, and they are also often different qualities or aspects of the same thing.

**The Truth Evolving**

The Future Truth, definitely, is much higher than ours. So, in future, our Truth is False – it could even be a crime. But, in the Present, we have nothing to do with this. Vikings, they had their Truth –they had nothing to do with the fact that Christians, eventually, bring them more truth, or that Science, eventually, brings more clarity, or that whatever will replace the current science, would also help us further.

As I find a Truth in Meditation, and accept it – the opposite Truth comes very fast to my mind, so that I really have to go deep to not just make contradictionary arguments to people. I use the letter “k” in my letter system for such quality – when you implement one Truth, what you miss, is the opposite, and the opposite is based on so different model that all you get, is simply a contradiction.

In Truth as it’s expressed in Material Form, it does not help us much that eventually, they are but aspects of the same Truth – I think that the same contradictions, or paradoxes, on higher and higher levels they come back; we solve many paradoxes between the opposites – but as we proceed higher, those paradoxes reappear in forms we need to solve. This negative force becomes so important that we seemingly fall down, we lose our positions and need to search again.

**The Mathematics Played**

We find a nice strategy to keep everything nice, to keep everybody very happy, and to get our deserved part. This goes into effect, but then – people change in ways that our Truth won’t work any more. We have been stagnated. Often they simply don’t like that our Truth works, we seem to be so sure in life, but actually – for the world it’s easy to change in such way that all we got was false-certainty. We learn a strategy of Chess, for some time we only win, but then it becomes easy to

overcome for others. Some business makes it to the end, the strategy is perfectly working – but then it’s simply old.

In reality, when we apply our mathematics, the facts might simply run away and make it obsolete; so in all the ways, we need to be creative all the time, and have a healthy yin aspect, which changes the direction when the river starts going backwards. Nobody really likes if we base our lives on simple tricks – they can soon do those themselves, and then they would not get much out of it.

When reality is playing with our mathematical conception, it becomes a mathematical fact that it’s changed. We can make a theorem about people, or atoms, but then they react to this theorem and behave differently. We see a mathematical theorem falling apart, and being replaced with another thing.

So in the world of theorems, there is the wind blowing, the water flowing, the fire burning, and the Heaven and Earth doing their opposites.

**The Truth Changing in the Nature**

In the Nature, through many processes like Evolution, the Truth is Conquering the World. The natural processes get closer and closer to Truth.

This is Manifested Truth, and this is more or less all we have – in the Real Expression of Truth, it’s important how it manifests. We can see that this is a process, which never ends; the Truth it cannot reach – it’s not Truth, because it’s unreachable. You cannot say a True Way is Way to Nowhere, even if it’s very good Nowhere; it’s the Place, which does not exist, and thus – the Truth, it has to be something, which exists. Maybe the Truth is to live forever in absolutely happy society, but in real world, we have to handle the people passing, we have to handle the crime, and if we only follow this truth – we are doomed to fail. So the Truth is running around those things and emerging in different patterns, where we get closer and closer to it’s final state; sometimes falling back and taking even deeper experience.

So, Experience is the Nature of Truth – it has the Negative Side, the Side of Becoming, not only the Side of Being.

**The Cycle**

As I begin this text, I want to repeat this:

You get into higher States of Mind, you get Enlightened, you have Satoris. You solve the equation about how to be perfectly happy, energetic, active and how to make your will bring you further and further. It seems like a Final Truth.

Then, finally, the Reality shifts away, you see an old pattern or problem there, without any Truth, without any Reason, looking like it only wants you to feel bad or fail your Enlightenment. The energy flows out, and you are back in the Cycles of Karma.

Then, as it happens again and again, you can see that there is something about what Buddha said, there are Three Noble Truths, starting with Dukkha. You can see that Truth itself – it’s Yang aspect perfect and complete – is having the Yin aspect, it struggles around in incomplete world and cannot find itself. Somehow, these laws have to be part of you to really be happy – you cannot overcome them. The Truth itself, it finds itself in the World of Change.

The Harmonic Truth, it’s the Yang, and when it shines through – it’s so complete and so powerful that we can easily start thinking that nothing lower would happen any more. We are in a Final State, and we don’t move any more. This is the Illusion.

Every time, there is the Fall – like the Leaves Fall and Nature continues it’s cycles, we start feeling the Inevitable Power of Karmic Cycle, and this is the Yin aspect. It’s seemingly not True, as it’s not up to our Metaphysical Criteria – but, from this point, we must understand that this Irrational, Cryptic, Not-Explaining-Herself, aspect of Nature exists. It must be a part of Metaphysical, we must not say it’s “lie” or that it’s “wrong” – it Really Exists, and the Reality, you cannot avoid, must be True. Maybe it’s about the people – they might be wrong in representing the Earthly chains to us.

Maybe it’s about many things we have not won, like the Mortality or Poverty. But, if all those things are wrong and to be overcome – we can see, there is something very real, which always brings all those things to us.

The Nature of Experience is not only Law of Rhythm and Polarity, but in Hermetics as well – it’s also that the Past was Less Than the Future. So, in Future, it must be better. I guess in Future, from millions of lives, we always have some of struggle, as we want to grow even higher; and the higher, it always suddenly becomes a norm, something we can not avoid. What is lower today – is simply impossible in future. We cannot avoid that. But, forever, we can see that the Truth is in constant play – it has the yin nature, in which it’s not unbreakable or indestructible, but it has to go through long journey and developments to gradually become better; it has to be completely different depending of time, of histories and stories, of personalities; the Seeds of Truth, which lead different people to enlightenment or better life – they are different. There are the Great Contradictions, which we would avoid in Logical Theory – but which appear in Life, as problems we undeniably need to solve; they make us follow different models, which do not fit completely together, but which allow us to progress by different principles.

The highest paradox is the Yin and Yang itself – the paradox between the Mind and Matter. The Matter, it’s in process of Evolution, in death and destruction; yet it’s the only thing, where Creation even happens. The Mind, it’s in it’s final states, perfect and complete – yet, it only shows up sometimes. Between those two, there is a great paradox; it’s nearly impossible to see those two as aspects of the same thing – it seems, if one is wrong, the other is true. If material sciences are true, nothing should be done with the Mind; if spirituality is true – matter is simply, well, a form of energy, to simply be reshaped by Love, and we never need the Material Science or Reasoning at all. We would simply know it all and do it all. In reality, both principles show up in undeniable force – the principle of Mind, in perfect clarity and harmony; the principle of Matter – as something non-meaningless or irrational, but completely undeniable, simply coming to our thoughts, breaking all the order, and bringing us to “nonsense-cycle”. If one exists, it seems, the other could not even exist. But, for real – as we deny one of them, things become considerably worse. I would say, there are no futures without Manifestation, with Truth existing alone; as there are no futures without the Synchronicity, something Higher appearing, which completely convinces us it’s perfect and complete, once we see it. But, still – there is some grand contradiction, and as we solve it, it only gives more contradictions to solve; so, maybe, it’s an infinite source of new contradictions, and new developments as we solve them.

Maybe, for real – some things have contradictions, but despite this, they have proofs so strong that they still exist. Maybe the reality, it has even bigger paradox if all of those would not work as real forces. We can almost disprove them in essence, but they come back into our lives. The Yang – it’s

always so strong experience that it seems to finish all the cycle, to solve it all, it’s the nature of the Truth or the Enlightenment; but despite this – the Yin, although it seems to be simply False, so irrational it is, comes back and just starts doing it’s irrational things; and it’s so strong that undeniably – really, it also has to be True. It’s just Another Nature of the Nature. If you think it’s False, you really cannot solve your equations – why something False so surely comes? If it’s False in sense that you don’t consider it – you are definitely on the wrong track. You have to take it serious, and thus, solving the Dukkha is a good thing to do as a Buddhist; or in Christianity – you can also think why the Female aspect of the Nature is Negative; in calculation it seems to give False, so logically it kind of cannot happen, but this False still happens – so it must be True. It does not give you it’s reasons, as those are ..well, to unbecome ..but the ways it needs to undertake are complex harmonics, things similar to ones, which happen in Nature – without explanation, it does and does and does, and you can finally understand it’s a Good Thing. This great False – it does and does and does, and finally you can be sure you cannot avoid that. You have to change yourself, not this thing, as it finds another way and comes back, being even more clever and more tricky, doing it’s next devilish thing as surely as it did the last one. In top of the world, you won’t think that – because what you see is simply True, and how can the True go away? But it does, and the undeniable False just wants it’s part, it just breaks the harmonies and makes you heal yourself. But when it’s done – the next True you see, it’s so much, that it’s still surprising you; as you have taken the journey in Nature, the journey in Negative, the journey in the False, or trip to the Hell if you go even further than that – as you come back, it’s much, much more than before. So the False, it really is like a woman – you can be annoyed by all their demands, but finally they do their work and you can see you are better off and experienced.
