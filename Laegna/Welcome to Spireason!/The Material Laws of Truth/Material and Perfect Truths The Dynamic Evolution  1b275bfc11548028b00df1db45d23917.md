# Material and Perfect Truths: The Dynamic Evolution of Values and Goals

Truth has always been a deeply contested concept—both in philosophy and in our lived experiences. Traditionally, truth has been framed as either an absolute, unchanging entity (often associated with perfect ideals) or as a mutable, evolving process tied to human experience and material reality. However, these two ideas are not diametrically opposed but are instead two facets of a larger, more complex system of truth. In this article, we explore two primary dimensions of truth—Absolute Truth and Fundamental Truth—while considering how they relate to the dynamic nature of human life, experience, and even physics. We will see how these terms map onto a system of dynamic truth values that help bridge the gap between static, absolute logic and the fluid, material realities of our world.

### **Absolute Truth: The “Dead” Values**

Absolute Truth is the domain of values that are stable, fixed, and immune to ethical, emotional, or material changes. These are the "dead" values that exist in a realm of mathematical and logical precision—values that do not shift based on time, context, or perspective. For example, the principle that “an even number divided by two results in another integer” is a fundamental truth that is unchangeable. Whether it's the year 3000 or 4000, or whether you're in a different culture or dimension, this truth remains the same. It is not subject to any subjective experience, desire, or emotional condition.

However, while Absolute Truth represents a perfect, static value, it is not always practically accessible in its purest form. We can approach Absolute Truth through rigorous measurement, logical deduction, or scientific experimentation, but in practice, there are always variables and uncertainties. Our understanding of mathematical or physical laws may become more precise over time, but it is always subject to the limitations of our instruments, knowledge, and perspective.

Thus, Absolute Truth can be thought of as something we continually strive toward. It is the goal of certainty, but this certainty is never fully realized—it is an ideal that exists as a guiding force, a beacon we pursue but may never entirely attain. In this sense, Absolute Truth is foundational in providing us with direction, but it is, by its nature, somewhat distant and idealized. It defines the horizon toward which all knowledge, logic, and science aim.

### **Fundamental Truth: The Dynamic Stabilizing Value**

On the other hand, we encounter what we call Fundamental or Foundational Truth. This is the dynamic, evolving force that provides the stabilizing equilibrium in our ever-changing world. Unlike Absolute Truth, which can be seen as fixed and static, Fundamental Truth arises as a result of the dynamic interplay between our material reality, goals, and experiences. It represents the ideal state of balance—a goal that is perpetually pursued but never fully realized in any static or final sense.

Fundamental Truth is analogous to the stabilizing forces in nature—like gravity or energy—that keep things in motion while providing structure to the system. It can be understood as the "meaning" of any system, an ongoing process rather than a final product. Take, for instance, the value of a stock you purchase. The value of that stock today may not be representative of its ultimate worth. The future value, which reflects the success or failure of the business it represents, is the "goal" of the investment—however, this value is constantly in flux, as it shifts according to market conditions, investor sentiment, and material changes.

This brings us to the idea of **goals** in the material world—goals are not immutable values but dynamic endpoints that evolve based on changing circumstances. Fundamental Truth, then, reflects a process-oriented approach to truth: a direction, a shift, or a goal that emerges from an evolving system of values, actions, and decisions.

In this sense, Fundamental Truth is what you would use to measure the “success” or “failure” of any process—whether it's a business decision, a scientific experiment, or the trajectory of your personal development. While Absolute Truth gives you the "laws of the universe" as fixed points, Fundamental Truth gives you the guiding principles of *how to operate* within that universe. It’s about what happens when we interact with the material world, adjust to change, and shift our goals and strategies accordingly.

### **Dynamic Logic: Moving Beyond Binary Truths**

To conceptualize these two kinds of truths in a practical way, we need a more flexible logical system. Traditional binary logic—true or false, 0 or 1—is too rigid to capture the fluid nature of reality as we experience it. In a static system, once a statement or proposition is determined true or false, it is locked in place. However, in the real world, truth is constantly evolving based on context, experience, and interaction with the material world.

Therefore, a dynamic system of logic is more appropriate for representing these shifting truths. I propose a four-truth value system that accounts for the evolution of goals and the inevitable uncertainties of our experiences:

1. **Absolute Truth**: These are the "dead" values—immutable, stable truths that do not change, like mathematical laws or basic logical principles. They represent the perfect, fixed values we strive toward but can never fully embody in our practical lives.
2. **Desired Future Value**: This is the aspirational goal that reflects where we want to be. It's not fixed, as it evolves as our circumstances, understanding, and perspectives change. The value of this goal shifts constantly as we progress, similar to how the stock market value changes over time based on shifting forces.
3. **Actual Present Reality**: This represents the material world we currently inhabit—constantly changing and subject to uncertainty. Unlike Absolute Truth, which is constant, the present reality is a living, evolving process, measured relative to goals and values. It’s a snapshot of where we stand right now, within a dynamic system that continuously updates itself based on our actions, decisions, and environmental factors.
4. **Failure/Imperfection**: Failure is an integral part of this system. It reflects the times when we fail to meet our goals or when the actual results deviate from our aspirations. This error is not the end but a crucial part of the learning and growth process. In this system, failure is measured not as a loss but as part of the process of understanding and evolving toward new goals.

This dynamic, four-valued system reflects the ongoing interaction between certainty (Absolute Truth), uncertainty (Actual Reality), and aspiration (Desired Future Value), constantly adapting to new contexts and new information.

### **The Material World and Its Uncertainty**

In this context, the material world becomes a system of uncertainty, where truths are constantly in flux. This is often referred to as the realm of material change—the realm where experiences, actions, and consequences shape the world. In physics, particularly in quantum mechanics, we see that the certainty once assumed in classical mechanics gives way to uncertainty. The famous *Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle* illustrates that certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, cannot both be precisely measured at the same time. This mirrors the uncertainty of our own lives, where absolute clarity is often impossible. The very nature of our existence operates in this state of uncertainty.

Just as quantum mechanics updates its models and theories in response to new data, we too adjust our goals and truths in response to our evolving understanding of the world. The material world, like physics, requires us to accept that our truths are relative and subject to change.

### **Material vs. Ideal: A False Dichotomy**

The tension between material reality and ideal, spiritual or absolute truth creates a false dichotomy in many philosophical, religious, and scientific systems. On one hand, we may dream of an ideal world where all contradictions are resolved, and all material struggles cease. On the other, the material world is filled with imperfections, failures, and changes.

In a perfect world, there would be no need for goals, no need for evolution or growth. Pain and pleasure would cease to exist because there would be no evolution, no change, no development—nothing to strive toward. But such a world, while desirable in some abstract sense, would also be a static, unchanging world, devoid of meaning or purpose. The journey itself—the dynamic interplay between goals, uncertainties, and values—would cease to exist.

Therefore, both material uncertainty and absolute ideals must coexist in a balanced system. Our desires, aspirations, and goals push us forward into the unknown, constantly updating and evolving, while the absolute laws of logic and mathematics provide the necessary foundation for making sense of the world. Together, they create the tension that drives human growth and evolution.

### **Conclusion: Truth as a Dynamic Process**

Truth is not an absolute or static thing. It is a process—a dynamic, ever-evolving interplay between the perfect (Absolute Truth), the goal (Fundamental Truth), and the material reality in which we exist. By adopting a flexible, multi-valued logic system that accounts for the imperfections and uncertainties of the material world, we gain a better understanding of how truth operates in our lives.

Rather than seeking a static, unchanging perfection, we must accept that our goals, values, and realities are constantly in flux. We must navigate this uncertainty with a dynamic understanding of truth—where failure and imperfection are not the end but essential parts of our ongoing evolution. In this system, truth is not a destination but a journey—one that evolves with us as we grow, learn, and interact with the world around us.
