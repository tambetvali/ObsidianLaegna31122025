# The Law of Imperfection and Karma

**The Law of Imperfection and Karma**

**The Law of Imperfection and Karma**

The **Law of Imperfection** is a Law I stated – and it’s so general that in some forms, it has probably existed before – to fight with the **positive attitude of Existence**.

It states that in Reality, there exists no Ideal, but only a state of Becoming; the **Law of**

**Impermanence** of Buddha is also highly related. This is highly visible in Human Life, but then – it must be there in many forms, also including the **Physical Form**.

First, humans themselves are Physical, and in how we are – it’s highly visible that the physical world contains such attribute, yearning for our True Value, whereas we can reach only the Progress, never the Destination. As Destination is the only Reason for Progress, we must enjoy our life every day, but we must continuously pursue for Ideal. In World of Ideals, the Ideals exist – Buddhism states our Mind is in it’s Finite, Ideal State, and the Truth itself – it appears or it hides, but it’s certainly an Ideal in it’s own Essence; the Truth rather ***operates*** than ***is*** – this is the attribute of the material world, of manifestation.

The Law of Imperfection states, that the Matter, then, must pursue higher ideals, but appear in the forms, which are much less ideal; also for the Matter, it’s the never-ending story.

The Law of Karma – as we do Wrong, from our actions, the Wrong is implied, and from our Being, the Wrong is implied. The True is the Value things take, it’s the *Real*, *Possible* thing – Law of Karma either works directly; if there is a False, it’s not logical, and the Truth would restore it, thus making our actions impossible, but as logic also goes backwards – if A => B, then from not B, follows not A; if we do something wrong, somewhere appears the False value, and when this starts to unbe, this Logical Process also affects the result of what we do, it affects our doing, and it also attacks ourselves. It also exists in non-direct forms, as the Way might be complex and not direct – as Law of Karma simply introduces the True value, which is more Possible and more Desirable by Reality, it operates in many ways – God’s Ways are Unexplainable; this sentence also holds for the Basic Law, which itself can be seen as Attribute of God (which is the Whole, the Truth). God exists or not – but here we see the Truth is manifesting itself.

Through the Law of Imperfection, the Law of Karma is in Imperfect State, so it manifests slowly, gets stronger. The Good is bound to win in the end, but these Victories become more and more direct, it’s becoming the rule rather than a long battle. Even the evolution connects cycles, which are true, and we can see that it might take generations, but then the higher qualities would win.

Experience can show, also, that when the Karma solves, we see there were deeper causalities, by which the Law was already perfect, and our story was perfect – but, this, is not visible to the naked eye, and it can be painful and long journey before we start to accept such realities; and into deeper and deeper, we still find the process of Karma being unexplainable now. As the Imperfection exists, the Law of Karma also takes into consideration that we *need experience*, we need to learn to create our own input for the solutions.

**The Law of Evolution and it’s relation to Truth**

The Force, which is behind the Evolution, is the Love. This is the strongest force, arguably, which we can feel in human life. The Love is a complex pattern of envisioning how we create new people, new genes and species, and in Higher Love, how we unite the whole unified cultures into genetic union. The equality is in both union and diversity – when we don’t unify the genes, create a common family, we still unify them to cooperate. I think the Soul Family of Highest Chakra can be seen as our Future Family, whereas the Body Family of Lowest Chakra is our Past Family. In Higher Love, we have the Chemistry to do flirting and all the work for creating the Future Family, to create a tribe or a culture – we React, in Higher Love, to create such. So the Love is the Intelligent Designer of the Evolution, and I think if the genes of us are directly creative – well, what we can feel in our biology as we create new people, is also a physical love. Love is one of the most creative forces, and thus the Evolution is Creative.

**Shiva Aspect of Evolution**

This is the aspect of Selection. It’s also Yin, to destroy the negative, or to separate into a distinct culture or species, which follows it’s own creation. There is a Creative Yin Force, which creates the numerous forms, Good and Bad – and there is the Natural Law of Karma, which will select the Cycles of the Better Karma, which connect the Good Ends with the Good Ends, to Select the Outspring.

Evolution does not add it’s own laws, but it follows the Law of Karma – the basic, fundamental Law. It creates the Good End, namely, that as the iterations of this Calculation go, the result is better and better.

It follows the **Law of Imperfection** – if we see God as the Whole, the Evolution is God’s

Deductive Thought Process. It creates numerous creatures by it’s yin aspect, and it selects some of them by Causalities Appearing; the True value is going to win and the False value to lose. Why the True value wins? Because it’s an aspect of Truth – the value, which wins, is True. We can see the evolution definitely brings us closer to the ideal of the Sensible Whole; the Spirituality itself has been created through evolution, and we can agree that if it exists, it takes us to such direction, which we see as ideal. If Mind has any matter at all, it aligns with the Cosmic Mind, or the Patterns of Karma – we can see it has fundamental nature, in sense that we really sense what we sense; the patterns our substances take to create the mind screen, is aligned to it’s perceived meaning. We can see that the Mind has to be true, as the Space which separates the Minds to different creatures – the Matter in Between, it must be true (it’s like a horror if there is only a biological mass with no space left in between).

I think there are many real causes and effects and harmonic laws in this process, and the Fabric of Cosmos slowly becomes aware of this; the Law of Evolution becomes aware of itself, the Cause and Effect inside start to experience more and more their existence.

**Vishnu Aspect of Evolution**

This is the here and now.

By our decisions, we change the current product of Evolution. We as humans, we can simply choose to be different. With Peace and War, we also change the current state. It’s a very intellectual, active

state of being something – and whether we survive, is dependent on this creative decision, as well as who we are, is dependent of this.

**Brahma Aspect of Evolution**

I did read once, that Light moves to the patterns, which are possible in Nature, and it even starts from light years away already destinies to fall into it’s perfect reaction. I think the light of the Mind does the same – and then, the reaction itself can change the Future; the waves of our Mind can directly interact with the future, by changing the states where the Light wants to be. So, in our structure there is something futuristic. I think it’s the Intristic Property of Everything What Is – it’s somehow connected to the Future, and it can also remove the uncertainty of the Past later.

Brahma is the aspect of Creation; and it takes longer for it to reach the Parts, the genetic Laws of the Universe, so that our genes or atoms would use less trial and error – but reaching there is the nature of *experience*, and also that mathematically, evolution itself exists in the space of

multiplication, and mutations of rules, and thus finally gives the Creation of such level, and aligns it with Creation on higher level.

The Creative Aspect of Evolution is also Love – this is the complex force, which creates Soul Families, which know how they give offspring in the Future, and connects Loves on the Lower Levels from the Love from the Higher Levels (we can see all that psychologically) and also creates the complex dynamics of the Couple – with a force so strong that it alters almost everything we do; the Force of Creation.

**Conclusion**

The result of Evolution we can call Truth – in our everyday Truth, Law of Karma works by connecting the Energy Circles, where the Energy starts to grow by an Ethical Principle, and by removal of the Block Circles, where the Antienergy starts to grow. Energy is the force towards greater good, and the bad energy is the opposite force; also the potentials in standing still.

The growing energy circles, they connect True with True by implication, and as they create circles, and those circles gain acceleration – less True values produce more True values, the implication curve turns up; those are there to stay. In this way, the evolution, and the causality itself, is always connecting the Law of Karma stronger and stronger. What generates energy, is made more powerful by this energy. It’s infinitely growing, the complexity and wisdom of Karma growing together.

**The Law of Complex Reason**

The Complex Reason is active directly – particles and atoms exist, with their Laws, but the complex creation also has it’s Laws, and mathematically, those Laws directly exist. I think the pleasure and pain is an aspect of Laws of Reality – thus, when humans lose their meaning, they might find peace in falling apart and giving room for higher species, as the Law, which holds them together, gives a way to our souls being reborn into higher form. As the Reasons of each separate human or animal are eternal, as we dye, our primary reason or karma will be reborn into the higher race, as higher being – but carrying further our pleasure and pain. We are directly connected to our Reason, so we do not care about life so much, when it starts to appear in a Higher Being. I think we do not reincarnate in multiple instances at the same time, as the Reason holds as one single Reason for the Space. I think the True and False is so strongly connected over Space and Time to do this Miracle.

But the Mathematical Truth gives rise to Reality, and thus our separate beings are True, not only the implications – they exist directly. This is what we feel about the Reality.

As the Reality is Evolving, and this is the material principle, which restructures the matter – we see the Higher Laws, which express themselves at least through Evolution, but visibly through many more Laws, or a wider view of an Evolution, for example by Love, Peace and War, and also by Changing our Nature as much as we can, to Already Be another race or being; to *already grow* higher, or to *change*. In many ways, psychological or physical, we can change and give rise to attributes the Evolution is seeking, or the Love creating. The Love is also a Force in our Lives, not only the Creation – it unites people and creates the higher structured matter today, not tomorrow, in our own forms. So it can go to different degrees – unite the Female and Male energy, or a Group Energy, to form synchronicities, or to give a Material Form to being embodying this synchronicity as it felt good. It also creates the connection of creating those material degrees in future generations – this is our Soul Family, the Higher Structure we are going to build, and in this, flirting happens in higher degrees, giving a form for many stable relations – your wife might not marry another man, but find out that their children, indeed, should marry, or the offspring of them. This kind of relations are also classical. In modern society, it can create scenes, which have millions of persons, who connect together in such way to create a society or a culture, and who probably work a lot to decide, in which order and which combinations to try.

We see this evolution going upwards by Giving Life to Numerous Forms (pre-evolution), Selecting (evolution) and Creating (post-evolution, Love). As Space itself, when we look it as matter, is having great pain and pleasure in wanting to become something, we can say that as those are the direct processes and the laws apply directly – they are no weaker than atomic laws –, the universe contains a principle of Imperfection – the Matter is moving in ways, which wants to be structured better.

**Implication in Physics**

In Physics, Chemistry, Astrophysics etc. we need to study the *Desire* of Matter, and the *Forces Involved*. Thus way, we learn, how to achieve better Karma in Physical Space. This is kind of Alchemistry, which wanted to arrange matter into higher states, not merely use every possible reaction in our own good. This is a Spiritual Science, which is needed as soon as possible, and needs a lots of work – as we see how the matter is better organized, and it’s life cycle as well has better Karma, we do the Karmic Work of Survival in the Material World.

Also, how we organize matter as we colonize planets like Mars? As we restore the climate and ecosystem of Earth? As we choose all the life and production, and garbage processes? There must be underlying Reasons – the Law of Imperfection gives us the Law of Karma, and we are interested in studying this – by creation of Truth around us, the True states, we do not imply False, and thus, we ourselves are not implied to be False; if something is impossible, then the creator of this thing, who does not learn from this – also becomes impossible in turn. If A => B, then not B => not A, which is the Law of Karma. By such implications, the complex causalities become to be, and as we interact continuously and repeatedly with matter, we create cycles – these cycles, in turn, give us the meaning or take it away.
