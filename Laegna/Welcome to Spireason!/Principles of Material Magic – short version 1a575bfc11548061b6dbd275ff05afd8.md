# Principles of Material Magic – short version

**Principles of Material Magic – short version**

**Principle 1 – the Law of Karma**

In material world, the material Karma is keeping you back from *Material Enlightenment*. You need to work with your Karma in the material world to overcome this.

This is the material karma:

- Your body and reaction with direct environment might not elevate the matter, but create material blocks.
- Your world-view, like the attitude about global problems, might not be sensible.

You extend the principle of Karma to: the Material Karma.

Law of Karma is a Buddhist main Axiom; the Law of Cause and Effect. My short, mathematical version of it: as your actions imply something, they must be more True or False as the thing they imply is more True or False, so if there is a reaction against the implication, it becomes to be reaction against the cause. Even the Evolution – it does not have it’s own goals, but it reacts with Law of Karma and thus is the Creation of the Destroyer-God Shiva.

**Principle 2 – the Law of Attention**

To become enlightened materially, you turn your deep meditative attention to material world.

Attention is powerful force and this applies to the material world as well; you meditate directly on your material sensations.

You extend the Law of Attention to: the Material Attention.

**Principle 3 – the Law of Intention**

Good intention is possible even when you do not understand the matter really. You need to grow a deep intention to understand the material karma and to improve it. The intention itself is going to heal your Karma and guide you to the right path – right intention is more powerful force than all the scientific work with environmental global problems.

Right intent is part of the Eightfold path.

**So on what my Theory is based on?**

I take the most basic Axioms of Buddhism, and show their direct applications in Material World, and this should be the way to Alchemy, Hermetics, or Material Magic – but, rather miracles than *being over* or manipulating the *matter*; rather it’s a *co-creation* with material principle (and thus, not a witchcraft in the ancient, manipulative sense of this world – note that many modern witches are also basing their theories on ethics).

**Neutrality**

You need to meditate freely through good and bad feelings about matter, and not create one materially successful character or affirmation – your character, and it’s effects to world surrounding it, need to be meditated so that you also go through the bad experiences. By such meditations, you create a character, which is not trying to create a material superiority, and not starting to feel empty and meaningless later – all the bad thoughts you get, all the bad sensations, you need to enlighten them to avoid such results associated with witchcraft. Also, the more positive ones – you get some feelings that the material world would completely transcend, that the material laws themselves would get elevated; to reach the material heavens – you also pay attention to this. But generally, you remain balanced and create a better future out of your here-and-now conditions.

**Eightfold Path – in terms of Material World**

1. Right understanding (Samma ditthi) – you need to understand the Material Karma.

2. Right thought (Samma sankappa) – you need to think right in material terms.

3. Right speech (Samma vaca) – your speak needs to elevate the material world.

4. Right action (Samma kammanta) – you take correct action in sense of materials.

5. Right livelihood (Samma ajiva) – you live a materially beneficial way.

6. Right effort (Samma vayama) – your effort is directed to solve the global problems of material world, and to make your surroundings materially better.

7. Right mindfulness (Samma sati) – your mind is well-functioning about the material world.

8. Right concentration (Samma samadhi) – you have the right concentration in terms of the material world.

**Five Elements**

You can learn five elements from Buddhism. I made it simpler in terms of frequencies:

Three Substances

- Cosmos, Ether or Space: This is the element of synergy in material world, the yang aspect of it. It creates a dream-like experience of the material world, where it flows as one thing. One object, here, is seen as part of infinity – the oneness of the world itself, or your local loka.
- Fire: This is the element of objects and bodies, it sees material world as objects. World is divided into objects. This is the toy world effect.
- Earth: This is the material substance as particles, matter flows into the bodies and out of them. Objects themselves form multitude – one object is many particles. This is the irrational, also temporary nature of natural elements, the element of them being born and dying.

Two energies

- Air: This connects matter to higher goal, making it directed.
- Water: This connects matter to it’s irrational goal, flowing through changes in the material world; this is the roundedness of personality.

**Yourself as matter**

You see yourself as matter, and the material aspect of your mind – instead of being rational, the material aspect reacts irrationally like material elements, getting “out of control”.

Your body is also matter, and as matter inside is the same as matter outside – you can see, even matter must have some rudimentary mind or feelings, and so the whole of the Universe. You are no different. The same physical laws exist inside and outside – mind is said to be achieved with certain mathematical complexity; but then the simplicity – it must also have some mind-like qualities, of which the mental image is created. You as a person are complex of Karma to not be solved, the primary purpose – this is the part to be reborn or keep your identity through lifetime of changes of you.

**Principle of Imperfection**

You see that in human world, the goals are being unmet, the force you use might not get things done. This is the brokennes element of Cosmos – it has some goals and intentions, but then the outside forces and possibilities are applied, as well as inside incapabilities, and the goals are not met.

The pleasure and pain – I believe the part of you, which feels them, is the Reason itself; it’s the Reason, which takes care that all different people exist. You are there, because you are

mathematically true – so the mathematical laws create you. This is not the law of particles, but the law of wholes – the mathematical laws also apply directly to complex wholes, and those laws themselves are not made of particles (but there are kind of particles – as all the wholes are considered, they become simpler laws, which together make up the wholes).

I believe that, unlike it seems from physics: the material reaction is not one single unit, where reaction between two electrons is measured by single law, but it’s also a field of tensions and unmet conditions, where the force inside an electron is often different from what it really achieves. The mathematical reasons struggle to meet the higher conditions, but then, they are stopped by external and internal conditions. If the mathematical reason is the one feeling pleasure and pain – then, the particles must have them too. In case pleasure and pain do not exist, there is still the effect of feeling – they search for better conditions, and the reaction equation we see is the complete end result, but inside, a lots more of things are going on. I see this by extending the Law of Imperfection from humans to electrons – in case it holds for humans, it’s impossible that it’s not the deep, underlying reality; or, at least, it would make our model much more complex.

We see that matter is reacting to form more beauty – sense of beauty, it’s very much the same for humans and matter, as matter always forms beauty in all it’s forms, also the mathematics shares this, as the formulas often form beauty; this, because we are also mathematical creatures. As the matter is destroyed by forces like fire and chemicals, it loses the beauty – but it does not keep the result together with such force, ashes left would easily flow away with water, and change until they start

to form the beautiful crystal structures again. Thus, it’s possible that material structures also enjoy if you create art out of them.

By principle of imperfection, material karma exists.

**As you solve the Karma, you get Enlightenment**

As you solve your material Karma, the Wisdom starts to flow into you.

You can see that as you solve the Karma of using your mental powers – you lose the interest of, for example, impressing people instead of using the force directly for good – you get the inflow of information. So, for Material Enlightenment, you need to purify your will and intention for material magic, you use it to raise the material condition. Then, you get sudden inflow of information, you get a great inspiration.

**Concentrate on Material aspects**

As you meditate, concentrate directly on material aspects, not the activities of people, which bring forth those material aspects. For example, concentrate on things you need, and not the people, who pay you salaries or your business philosophy – you need direct and clear material mind to become balanced.

As businessman thinks about money and things he gets, not the relations of exact people involved – people come and go – you meditate directly on your material environment, and not the complex humans structures to build it. It’s directly material.

**Balance**

You do it here and now. You meditate on your material outcome, and the goals you have set to be met before you “start doing” – you have to live in the material world right now, not in the future; you do not have to meet your business prospects or get ready with certain developments of yourself or projects. The material world has to feed you right now, you need to grow together with a good material experience right now – you can see, many people know almost nothing, their job is just talking, or exchanging things, but with this little, they have done enough for the material world. So you meditate away the big expectations people have for you, the demands you make for yourself before getting the rewards – here and now, you are just good enough for a nice material experience, and this experience itself is the work you do.

**Meditations**

Globally: You meditate over direct feelings about humans active in ecosystem; some things seem dark, others bring glimpses of light – you meditate over your direct sensations of humans active in material environment.

Direct senses: You meditate over the most direct material sensations in your senses, and the material touch with the world; before you emotionalize and conceptualize such senses to be emotio-intellectual.

Body sensations: You can sense all your body biologically, which is a lots of meditations to do so; but then – you need to sense it materially. In addition to biological health, there is material health: is

the material composition of your body worth the good karma, does it materially enjoy it’s being and react well in the material world. Is it good material karma that you body, with it’s constitution and reaction, exists in the material world? In case a material False is implied by your body and reaction – the material Karma appears, the reverse-implication that if your material structure is bad, from it’s ends it starts to be disproven, to break down.

Material Karma: You meditate over the karma of materials with people; but here, you need to concentrate on – whether a material substance, on it’s own, is having a good material sensations or not.

**Material Empathy**

You need to be empathic with material structures on their own – not their reactions with people (which is also a karma of those and needs to be meditated as well), but the structures themselves; does it feel good or bad to be this structure – are there tensions, are there a desire to change. If matter has desire to change, it does; if you align it to good material karma, there appears material force to keep your material activities together – otherwise, there appears material block.

**Conclusion**

When you use all those laws and inspirations together, you should get a smooth, good growth towards material awakening, which helps both the beginner and advanced practicioner. So this path described here is both the path of meaningful material experience, but also to material

enlightenment and actual “magic”. This is good if those two fit together – you don’t know, how far you get, but at least you are on the right path.
