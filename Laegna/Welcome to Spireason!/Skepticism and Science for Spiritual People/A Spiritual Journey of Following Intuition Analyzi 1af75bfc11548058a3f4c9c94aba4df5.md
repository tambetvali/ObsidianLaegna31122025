# A Spiritual Journey of Following Intuition: Analyzing with Descartes and Russell

Intuition can often feel like a **compelling** force, urging us in a certain direction without clear reasoning or understanding of its source. Sometimes it feels like a whisper of **certainty**, an inner knowing that we should pursue a particular path or decision. But, just like our senses—color, shape, sound—intuitions are often fraught with **subjectivity** and **uncertainty**. The clarity of their meaning often arises over time, through careful reflection, and through the iterative process of **feedback loops** that allow us to refine and better understand the signals we are receiving.

This story of **following intuition** can be understood both through the lens of **spiritual practice** and the philosophical methods of **Descartes** and **Russell**, who both engaged with the themes of doubt, uncertainty, and how we come to understand and refine our beliefs over time. Let's explore such a journey with both theoretical and story-based elements, and examine how **Descartes' skepticism** and **Russell's problem of knowledge** can be applied.

### **The Story: The Uncertain Feeling**

Imagine a person, let's call her **Lila**, who feels an inner compulsion—a **nagging intuition**—that she should travel to a distant place. She does not understand why, but the feeling keeps recurring. It's not based on any clear evidence or logical reasoning; it's a **visceral pull** that feels like it has meaning. Initially, she brushes it off. It’s just an emotional whim, she thinks, a desire for change or an impulse. But the feeling persists, unshakable.

### **Phase 1: The Irrational Phase (Pre-Reflection)**

At first, Lila’s intuition seems utterly **irrational**. She doesn’t know where it comes from or what it means. She thinks it’s just a passing fancy, perhaps driven by restlessness or external factors like friends talking about their own travels. Here, her initial **response** to her intuition aligns with **Descartes' radical doubt**: she questions it. She wonders if this feeling might simply be a distraction or a result of something else—a fleeting desire, perhaps.

In this phase, Lila’s intuition is not grounded in any **logical structure** or **reasoning**. The feeling she has is akin to the **sensory perceptions** that Descartes questions in his **Meditations**. Just as Descartes doubts the reliability of the senses, Lila doubts the reliability of her feeling. She cannot yet discern whether this is a **genuine insight** or merely a product of her emotions and external influences.

### **Phase 2: The Reflection and Doubt Phase (Descartes' Skepticism)**

Lila then takes some time to reflect, and this period of **self-examination** mirrors **Descartes' method of doubting**. Descartes famously doubted everything—his senses, the existence of the external world, and even his own body. His goal was to find something that could not be doubted, something that was absolutely certain. Similarly, Lila begins to question the nature of her intuition: Is it **truth**, or is it merely a fleeting **feeling** with no foundation?

She begins to take a step back, **questioning** the source of her inner feeling. Why do I have this desire to go? Could it be based on something external—perhaps an event in her life, a change in her personal situation, or simply a desire to escape from her current routine? Is the intuition influenced by her **mind's wanderings**, or does it have an **objective source**?

This process of **skepticism** mirrors Descartes' approach of questioning what we **believe** to be true, especially when it is not founded on **clear evidence**. Lila seeks a deeper understanding of her feelings, engaging in a more **critical examination** of the sources and nature of her intuition. She begins to see that this feeling has persisted over time, despite her doubts and reluctance to act on it. The intuitive pull is consistent, and this consistency begins to convince her that there might be more to it.

### **Phase 3: The Clarity Through Feedback Loops (Russell's Problem of Knowledge)**

In the third phase, Lila starts to **act** on her intuition, but not blindly. She begins to gather **experiences**—small actions that align with her intuition, like researching the place she feels drawn to. She talks to others who have been there. She reads about the history and significance of the destination. Her **feedback loops** start to form.

This aligns with **Bertrand Russell’s idea of knowledge** in his **"Problems of Philosophy"**. Russell emphasizes that **knowledge** is built not on immediate certainty, but on the iterative process of collecting **data** and examining it in light of prior experiences. Just as in **scientific method**, repeated observations and reflections allow us to **refine our understanding**. In this case, Lila's initial uncertainty is replaced with more **clarity**, as she observes how this intuitive pull seems to fit into the broader context of her life.

At first, Lila could not explain why she felt compelled to go; it was an irrational feeling. But as she investigates it more deeply, she begins to notice a pattern. She recalls dreams, past experiences, and certain unresolved emotional challenges that seem to be connected to the places and situations she has been researching. Over time, she becomes increasingly confident that this **intuitive pull** was pointing her toward something significant. It wasn't **random**; it had meaning—but that meaning emerged only through **reflection, feedback, and careful investigation**, much like the scientific method in philosophy.

### **Phase 4: The Clarification of the Feeling (Realization and Buddhistic Meditation)**

Now, Lila is no longer in a state of confusion or blind belief. She recognizes that her intuition was not **irrational**, nor was it simply **wishful thinking**. Rather, it was a **reflection of deeper truths** she had not yet fully understood, and it was **shaped** by her life experiences and emotional state. The **same feeling** is still there, but her understanding of it has deepened.

At this point, Lila can apply the method of **Buddhist meditation**, which emphasizes the practice of **observing** thoughts and feelings without attachment or judgment. In the Buddhist tradition, all emotions and sensations are seen as **impermanent**—they arise and pass away. The goal is not to **cling** to a particular feeling or belief but to observe it with **equanimity** and **clarity**. In this way, Lila learns to **watch** her intuition—this inner pull to travel—not as something that **dictates** her actions but as a **message** from her deeper consciousness that she is learning to understand.

Lila’s experience becomes a **meditative reflection**, where she feels the intuitive urge to travel, but she no longer holds it with the same **emotional charge**. She no longer feels compelled by the same blind need to act upon it. Instead, she sees it as part of the ebb and flow of her **life experience**—a call, perhaps, for exploration or learning, but not a fixed destination or destiny. She understands that this intuition, like all things, is **subject to change**, and its meaning **evolves** through continued self-awareness and feedback loops.

### **Conclusion: From Irrationality to Clarity**

In the end, Lila's journey follows a path from **irrational intuition** to **reflective clarity** through the application of **skepticism**, **feedback loops**, and **meditative awareness**.

- **Descartes’ method** helped Lila recognize her intuition’s **uncertain** nature and question its origins. Through this, she learned to distinguish between fleeting **emotion** and deeper **truth**.
- **Russell’s approach** emphasized the iterative nature of knowledge, teaching Lila that intuition should not be acted upon immediately but refined through **observation, reflection**, and careful integration of feedback from her environment.
- Finally, the **Buddhist method** helped Lila attain **emotional clarity**, where she could observe her intuition with equanimity, learning not to cling to it but rather to **understand** its deeper meaning as part of the ongoing process of self-discovery.

Through this integration of Descartes, Russell, and Buddhist meditation, Lila ultimately learns to **understand** her intuitive feelings without being controlled by them. She no longer seeks to avoid them or act out of blind belief, but instead she observes, reflects, and refines her understanding in a **grounded**, **realistic**, and **calm** manner. The **feedback loops** between her feelings, actions, and reflections allow her to move forward with a clearer vision, without attachment or delusion, and with a deeper sense of **truth**.

This approach—carefully **questioning**, **observing**, and **refining** intuitive feelings—is not just a spiritual practice but also a philosophical method that can help anyone navigate the **uncertainty** and **ambiguity** of life. It demonstrates that intuition, like our senses, is valuable but requires thoughtful reflection and clarity to be truly understood.
