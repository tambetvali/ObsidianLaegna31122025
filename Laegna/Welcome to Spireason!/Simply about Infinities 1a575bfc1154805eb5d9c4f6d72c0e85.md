# Simply about Infinities

**One Simple Text about Infinities**

As we develop our Infinite Awareness and Infinite Creativity – one word, which we should study, is infinity. Here I give you a range of infinities, so that you can have so much insight into this topic that it’s possible to study further – and see, which kind of numbers you have to have in your mind as you develop a science for this all.

My work brings some consistency to spiritual realm – many spiritual people are not exactly scientists nor very advanced in math; often the points of math and philosophy you need to notice are quite trivial – but unless you go through this, you might talk a very clear point, but make

inconsistencies in your talk in some aspects, which you did not meditate on, which matter less to you or in which a skeptically minded atheist might be very strong in bringing their arguments against you; finally you get “debunked” and this is not the best feeling in the Universe, especially if you are basically right.

**Infinities**

**Range of Infinities**

Range: Minus Infinity, Zero, Plus Infinity. This equals two infinities – in both directions, you can count infinitely many.

You have bigger and smaller ranges of infinities. On discrete number system, natural numbers, you get properties of infinity for normal numbers. On continuous axe of real numbers, you get two dimensions of this, and I call this distinct relation an Octave.

Often, I use this minus number for another purpose – numbers so small that they are close to Zero.

**Infinities of Circle**

When Radius of a Circle is infinity, it’s angle at any point is zero (or 180 degrees – it does not exist). For circle with bigger radius than infinity, the angle must be negative. For circle with radius zero – it does 360 degrees in one point, therefore behaving like sharp angle; but as you zoom in – you see smaller points than zero; there, the space changes – with such sizes, bigger and smaller, dimensionality of space is growing.

**Infinities in Mathematics**

Limit theorems and differentiations show you the infinities, which I call qualitative infinities – they have a quality, but no number. Classes of such infinities have number properties, for example infinite size of set of all natural number, which is denoted by N, is smaller than R – the infinity of either real numbers, or points on infinite line.

As you reach zero you reach kind of infinity. Discrete numbers have all points having discrete distance, and here appear very small numbers with properties of infinity. I call such positive numbers E and negative numbers I. For finite numbers, I use numbers O and A in my system – finite negative and finite positive. For Zero, or unknown one of O and A, or unknown one of all 4 possibilities, I use U – these are 0’th, 1’t and 2’nd octaves of U, the smallest unknown called 0, the

next one is any of numbers between 1 and -1, and the last one is between 2 and -2. I use 1 and -1 for correlations to finity, and 2 to -2 for correlations of infinity; I close those from two sides.

- Infinite is the angle, when your function graph goes directly upwards. Number size of this infinity is about how much it goes upward. And there appears a Zero – how much it moves further by given distance, upwards-axe divided by forward-axe. This gives in mathematical differentiation proportions of values for differential axe going straight upwards. And in Tangens function, it does not give values for all x and y in division operation, but also 90 degree upwards value has a value as tangens – but this value is no different depending on whether it goes more or less up; but the values in the angle of tangens function must get infinitely closer to 90 degrees.
- Some zero multiplied by some infinity is a probability function with average of 1; like numbers behave in multiplication and division – it has infinite axe downward from 1 to 0, and infinite axe upward from 1 to infinity.
- When you multiply numbers, you have to square it’s unit – you have to sum, to the unit power, the powers of both numbers multiplied, or the all numbers multiplied. Then, when you make square of smaller-than-one axe, you get true infinity of points under one; and this axe is considerably larger than the one of not doing this operation. In square sized 0.01 times 0.01, there are infinitely many more points as the infinity has two infinite axes, and it’s 0.01 R²; when it’s 0.1 or 0.1 R squared. Similarly, it’s 0.01 cm² when it’s (0.1 R)^2. As the square has two dimensions of infinite size, when you make one number on axe of real numbers contain the same number of dots starting from zero to the size of this number, the

multiplication becomes positive. If you do the same operation for division – you add the axes; and the other side you have both multiplication and division available for making 0.1 R / 0.1 R be 1, but 1 sqrt(R) or 1 in units of square root of R. So you have 4 directions of those operations, and additional middle directions, where you leave the powers intact – which is the normal case. But as you have some units, by mathematical rules you would do operation of those units. As you take this squared line and make it one-dimensional, it still got two dimensions as it has two multiplies to infinity – so, *infinity is a dimension*. It’s a special number because at finite number axe, the exact place where the infinities meet are left open. But you can use discrete number law – instead of continuous numbers, which have infinite number of numbers between two given numbers, you use discrete axe, which has none – when you make natural numbers become infinitely close to each others, this numeric axe is contained in a zero, and it’s exactly zero-sized. You see that zero-length number has infinitely many numbers inside – I call this a vertical octave, which calls the position of this inversion operation a Zero, and this is the value of I for natural numbers, where I = 1, O = 2, A = 3 and E = 4, whereas U still equals 0 – U always equals zero. Inside U, there are also four possibilities, and when you multiply a number by U by multiplying also the

dimensions, inside this U are the digits or frequencies for one octave down. Horizontal octave is like multiplication is to addition to this operation – it goes so far, that going one octave up closes the range of these numbers inside U, I-E, and V (upside down U, which means the two extreme edges of minus infinity and infinity, but they are there still I first and E next, not turned around. This makes an angle to zero, which is infinitely smooth – it has no angle at all at one point, whereas zero has the complete angle at this point – it goes from negative to positive. Infinity and Zero are two numbers hard to catch. Now, this square on R²

axe you can measure, and so you can measure the line on R axe – multiplies of them create dimensions, which correlate infinity and zero on discrete or continuous number axe; but you can not find one exact dimension when you project this infinitely larger number to one-dimensional R scale – when finite numbers exactly meet infinity, is left open.

- This is the third mathematical property that you can project all points from two dimensional R² to one-dimensional R, or do such projections for any two given dimensions – you see that the relations between the numbers are really discrete, but there is one great *unknowable* which is the direct distance between any given finite number and an infinite number, but this *unknown* can have the qualities of the number – operations of those, in relation to each others, have number qualities. Namely, if theorem crosses such infinity, it has discrete value of True or False at a point. This point is now valued I or E, depending on the infinity turning up or down – so the number axe goes from vertical to horizontal, which starts going up or down in whole dimension.
- I use extreme, larger frequencies on infinities for an angle being so large that it actually goes backward. Natural numbers, in operation of multiplication (growing non-exponentially) do not go upwards on this axe. At one moment, when it’s 180 degrees backward, or in some angle relations 360 degrees, the multiplication and division also end, you cannot reach this function any more. To do even bigger operations, you have to make sure your numbers and four basic operations reach infinity. Thus, division and multiplication are -2 and 2 or I and E; plus and minus are 1 and -1 or O and A; and you need to use the fact that division and multiplication progressively close the upper point to zero, as addition and subtraction do in direction of zero itself. Somewhere, as in infinity, the angle at a point of circle is zero – and this is the limit value – there is also positive inverse, at bigger than the highest possible angles for classical math, the function turns inverse again. As we have infinite number of such inverses, I had to change the order of number system – at minus scale, it also goes from down to up, not vice versa, digit by digit. Sometimes I use A as plus zero and O as minus zero; this makes the real number axe kind of discrete.

**Solving infinities with projections**

*This is the most mathematical part of this text and you can leave it for better days, continuing with the next part directly.*

You have the algorithms to solve digits after comma, as they grow into infinity, into a rational number. For example, 0.(3) – where 3 is recurring into the infinity – can be written as 1/3. Now, when you make the maximum value of a digit exceed the limit of the number system – I call this a higher frequency digit – you would sharply run into infinity and there is no difference, when you make those numbers smaller or bigger.

Now, when you make your coordinate system slightly exponential, you get some digits back – when coordinates in your number space grow exponentially, you once again see that such numbers are bigger and smaller, they can be compared with each others. Now, measuring all relations – isn’t the coordinate system like this in the very beginning? You simply miss some parts of it – zero and infinity, whichever operations you do with them, seem like they are always the same and

unchanging. But in solution, you see one unknown – for example, any finite number divided by infinity would give you zero; but you can see that zero, once again multiplied with infinity (which is equal to division by zero) – if you solve it to range of operations giving you this, you see that you

get an unknown. Thus, you can see that your zero behaves like unknown – in other words, there is something about the zero you don’t know. The part you don’t know can be solved by your number ranges or space – your space must be extended so that it also accepts numbers, which a growing with less and less speed, or more and more speed; by this, you create a bigger coordinate range.

You see a property of this space – it extends beyond the infinity, but it loses one important geometric property, the last one left by evolving geometry: the case that the space itself, with affine translations, would always keep the *order of point*; original geometry kept many more properties, but with curved spaces we kept only this. It becomes complicated – with simple operations you can do with matrices in this extended space, *the order of points is not kept*. Thus, mathematically, this is a very hard kind of space – but really, it becomes kind of creative.

The operations with infinities, described in previous part, they become *unknown*, *undefined*, or not having a solution – in differential equations, you cannot take it for sharp angles; in math you cannot divide by zero; you see more and more places, where anything, which has to do with infinities and zeros, become undefined. But, around this, you see sharp properties of sizes and measurable amounts of these numbers – you can be sure in mathematical relations, which exist, and which let you work with concrete values.

If you want to express these infinities with digits, you need a *frequential system*. In infinity, the numbers get *more dimensions*, so I write my digits on several lines – the middle two lines, for example, might contain positive and negative finities; the line above this the first frequency of infinity and the line above – the first frequency under minus infinity. These digits are in *outer space*, where the laws of mathematics break. The shape of space becomes an exponential function. The digits in this space coexist, so that in *different dimensions* there are same digits coexisting. This is what is meant using the word dimension in spiritual context – different planes of frequencies create such dimensions. So for each chakra there is a dimension, as the chakras create suboctaves. In my number system (described later): Sometimes I do not use lines – I put marks like on ó and ò on top of numbers; so that if it goes up, it goes to upper line, and if it goes down, it goes lower; I use one or two such lines so that I get the four number values of mine – they behave like functions, up and down. For U and V I use, in my mathematics, dot or two dots over a number (or letter) – this way, the digits extend outside the finite range of the number system. As infinity functions are

approaching, I also say those numbers *go in this direction* – for example, it might be O, but go in direction of A – then I write Ó. This is the same effect as with Negative, it’s minus, but in infinity – it’s plus. This, because these frequencies grow like exponential numbers – they start small, and where the space is having the best ordered system of points, the finite and infinite part are equal; later, the infinite part grows bigger. With this markup, I say the numbers become ponegative – I call this operation ponegation, by which I have four logical values; now I also have four numerical directions in infinity, the concrete number being the value here and now, but the line giving it a meaning in infinity. Then, there are positive and negative plus and minus numbers, and this is like two-dimensional number system – the first dimension being space, the second one being the value itself; I use letters R and T – R is the movement of space of a number, where the same number moves so that it’s either positive or negative; T is the value here and now – which is very concrete, but it might be irrelevant or unmeaningful.

I use the word Octave for such disconnected frequencies, either from up to down, or larger to smaller – this, because, I believe a standard octave is a hologram of this effect into a finite space.

2D space, by using infinities (octaves, such higher and lower frequencies) becomes multi-d; even 1D becomes multi-d. Zero, while it contains no numbers, I believe it becomes multi-d as it’s dimension goes up – but this is another, more complex topic I do not wish to explain.

Here you see you can also measure infinite numbers by their *dimensionality*. They are in very linear and sharp – I mean, leaving no much space for uknowns. They have one certain unknown property – in terms of finite numbers, you cannot find the exact border of infinity; so as rich person has, in some units, infinite amount of money, in terms of simple things normal people count with money – they cannot say exactly, how one cup of coffee is having effect on their money; even if they can measure thousand cups of coffee. Here, the property of infinity creates an *unknown* – you know that there exists a number of coffee cups, which would make even a rich man poor, but you cannot say exactly the number; this value simply does not exist – it’s the value between finite and infinite number of cups of coffee. Many finite numbers get so direct properties of infinities, that they are approaching infinity; you can say they are “small infinities”. For example, general qualities – goodness and love – which are linear functions in infinity, but might not help you immediately out in finity (by goodness, you don’t directly get all the effects of cooperation); in entity so large as humankind, you can see the real effects of such infinite properties. Thus, the humankind, in those terms, is kind of infinite – you can see the effect of infinity already taking place. So in your life, you need to consider those infinities and they create you logic paradoxes I measure with I and E numbers – you can see there is acceptable amount of something, and there is too much, but you can never say who, when and at which finite point, exactly, reached that infinity of too many – the number which you don’t accept any more. In your thinking, thus, there might be bias – for example, socially, the cooperation effects approach infinity; but as you cannot say which people and when, for example, are producing too much garbage or toxic materials (and some garbage and toxic materials do not matter much), you cannot get people to move because they are not able to follow the function of infinity directly – at some point, you have destroyed yourself with toxic waste, but at any point in space and time, nobody produces exactly that much toxic materials to destroy you. So, as the function appears higher – in infinity –, but is the same physical cause and effect (you can say the function is *direct*, it simply happens in material world by law same strong as the law, which moves electrons – these are the direct laws of nature on higher organizational levels); so you can not say anything concrete to anybody – but, suddenly, you are dead, the whole planet is destroyed. So, the way how infinity comes to our logic – at first, it’s very complicated to understand. This is a topic to meditate on.

**Connection between infinity and zero**

*If you are not into math, also skip this part.*

The angles which are right under zero, are identical to the angles in infinity. Thus, I use the numbers I and O as negative numbers, but Í and Ó as overpositive numbers, which are inversed in positive direction, or let’s say – enversed. Number becoming minus number, it can become minus several times in the same direction; and there is also a polar attribute of plus – I use dot if the number is not inversing or enversing, not moving into lower or higher octave. The angles of circle, formed by radius n, I call the angles of number n – angles, which you meet right above zero, are the same angles you meet in absolute, total infinity – where the angle of circle first became a straight line, but then, outwards curved; when the outwards curve meets zero and then becomes mathematically non-linear, so that the points are not ordered any more and new dimension appears on straight line (you

now need more numbers to express it’s possible values); I use numbers À, È, I, O, A, E, Í, Ó (I might also use I, O, i, o, a, e, A, E – digits are abstract units and their values are to be defined by operations, with my standard operations, I reach different orders of digits) to express this whole range of numbers, and sometimes I use numbers 1-8, where 0 is going back to infinity from zero, and 9 is going back to zero from infinity – or, they might represent an unknown value of previous and next octave. I use V (or upside down U) for connection of both ends of infinities, which you can zoom in, and U for the zero, which you can also zoom in – in case the properties of infinities are not exactly on zero or infinity, which you can mathematically form, I write down the complete expression, which forms such number; but those are often uninteresting qualities of a number.

I use digits of comma in direction of infinity – with land of Earth, the circle or sphere becomes straight or flat locally; so, as it approaches this straightness, it’s radius must approach infinity. The number angle of such value, then, I say would be 0 – I use 0 for not turning up or down, which is 180 degrees. Digits, therefore, in this system, are part of a space, which has this 0 angle for E, 360 degree or complete angle for I (if it’s used as value infinitely approaching zero, not minus infinity, which I often need to do as I’m interested in how large the zero is – it’s also approaching infinitely, so creating a whole number space inside zero, inside the normal value of nothingness; this space is infinitely large); and the four numbers signify the four such angles – as you repeat the numbers infinitely, you get an absolute degree of such angle. To make my numbers even more usable in infinity, I assume that their exact value is dependent on one property of repeating them infinitely – they have this angle or degree, which would form if the numbers are repeated infinitely. Sometimes, I use more digits only to express more precise number between zero and infinity, or to express number in higher power – with powers of infinity, you get a straight line, but one octave away it’s curved again; powers of U I often use to show that number is even more unknown.

Like the four elements – I need my number digits for so many purposes that I start to interpret them kind of poetically.

**Point is two values**

Point is two values, not one – thus O and A together are in the center of line; a mathematical point on a line cannot be symmetrical, but it’s potentially growing in one direction differently than on another. For example, a function which is growing exponentially – at any point, the angle to the future must be bigger than the angle to the past; then, with such growing angle, it almost seems linear. Point, in both two directions, makes up different angles – there are also the higher order differentials. Curved line, it’s longer on one side than another, and this is the limit function even if it’s infinitely thin. When you zoom out, you connect infinity from the other side like this – this angle I call V or upside down U, and I use the low O sound to pronounce that (me myself, I pronounce them more or less in Estonian).

When you look at line, it has symmetric points – the same angle at both sides. When you look at a curve, sides of a point can be non-symmetric, despite the fact that it is at one point in the space. This is kind of paradox, but it explains lines and curves much better. Also, the angle of the curve is, in higher dimension, dependent on how the line is curved in infinity; in lower dimension – it also has a little angle in direction, which would become later an actual value; for example, a learning curve, which is zero for some time, and then starts growing as you produce something – in the beginning, the learning has zero degrees to production, but it’s actually an exponent function, which is the first angle taken towards production. I say such angles are smaller than zero, but exponential

– suddenly they start operating. I have many types of smaller-than-zero angles, but this type is very important.

**Infinity of Life**

Life is one infinity of material field; it’s an infinity-sized function executed in material substance of matter.

When the rudimentary senses of matter reach infinitely large oscillation in relation to their point size, that in mind and matter, then it appears as it’s living.

**Infinity of Theorem**

Theorem is a function, which holds infinitely in all real and potential range of events or truths; and thus it’s a theorem as it *always holds*. When theorem becomes material, it reflects the infinity in all potential. This is also a knowledge of wisdom, as it covers the material sphere.

**Infinity of Meaning**

When it appears to be point value on hologram, of infinitely large complex of oscillation, we sense this as higher meaning. When it has such relation to the matter, it might be material meaning – it’s in Space Element of buddhist system of matter.

**Infinity in Physics**

- Infinitely small size of particles of matter, which go sub-zero: as matter is smooth, continuous form, in relation to those properties the subatomic particles add a dimension, and by that reason the function between the sizes have to be seen as infinitely zero – those numbers are even downwards from where the 0 function meets.
- Earth or all circular bodies, which appear flat, are ininitely large in terms that when angle of a circle at a point becomes zero, the radius becomes infinite. This is zero when we consider a human-sized point; in relation to this point it differs from zero almost by none – thus, compared to human size, the size of Earth is very close to infinity. Of course, those digits before comma squared, I use the dot upwards, so that the digits left of it go to infinity – so small angles locally that we don’t see them. I use Z, X and Y as powers of lower octave, this octave and higher octave, and by combinations of these numbers I create more octaves.
- In Relativity Theory, there are certain limits – light speed, and the distance you can travel as you get closer and closer to light speed, but seem to remain trapped in something. These are properties of infinity, so the number of infinity has to be used for light speed – you can add more and more numbers, but it only approaches the maximum value, it does not reach it. This is the property of infinity.

**Infinity in Material Structures, and Space**

- Material aspect is seeing one as many – one body or one object consists of many particles.
- It’s higher organization into one movement in better direction is Spiritual. This has many objects, every object, organized into one Theorem.
- Mental, or middle, is the organization of matter into bodies and objects.

**Infinity in Time**

- Past is measured by infinitely smaller dimensions of time, and those times are colder and

colder backwards; time started slowly from almost zero – but always, there is a moment

before any given finite moment backwards.

- Future is measured by infinitely larger dimensions of time.
- The density of time of past and future, the whole number axe, is going as time passes.
- The now, or alternative the middle point of time and space – where it starts to grow

exponentially, the energy – this is denoted by 1 if you see time with multiplication and

division, or 0 when you see them as addition and subtraction. For multiplication and

division, chains of these operations – you can go infinitely downwards from 1 to 0, but you

never go over 0 unless you use negative numbers.

- Matter grows with the same speed with energy, so there is always a constant amount of

matter.

**Another infinity in Time**

- Positive infinity is where all the Time and Space is seen as one, and this one is being thought

about as whole; we can think about whether, the whole existence of complete time and space

is True or Untrue, in which directions it goes better and in which it does not; Religion is

aligned to this infinite quality – it teaches humans the attributes, which are to hold over the

space and time; namely, Goodness or Truth, they always remain the same – they are

conceptions which exist as extreme yang.

- Negative infinity divides Space into particles, and Time into moments, and the smallest

point in this spacetime we can see – it already contains infinitely many of these points. This

is the yin, female, multitude or negative aspect – negative is the relation of a point to so

many points; it’s so small particle that you call itself negative.

- Yinyang, the center, it has one unitary size in space and time. Your complete life is one unit

in time, or from the thing built to the thing destroyed it has one such unit in time; in space,

you yourself, or thing itself, forms an unit. Where we see such units in different scales, they

unite the infinity into spheres, which have attributes like will and intention.

**Infinity in Yin and Yang**

- Yin is multitude inside one; you see one body as multiple bodies – this an element of Earth.
- Yang is oneness inside many; you see many bodies as one body – this is an element of

Heaven.

- Yin-yang is unitary dimension, this must see one as one.

Yin and Yang, thus, have *frequencies*.

**Infinity in System of Chakras**

- Crown chakra is handling numbers with infinite point size, so it experiences the direction of Complete Space and Time.
- Root chakra is handling numbers of infinitely small size compared to bodies – in space, a body contains infinite amount of point; actually more.
- Heart chakra connects persons separately, and creates a creative, non-repeating pattern which minds every body or creature as separate being. Solar Plexus serves the same function of being middle, to the elements; and alternatively, they are located in human body around Space element, or yet another center, and form a two-dimensional sphere; we can guess as sphere goes into infinity in one dimension, this goes to infinity in two distinct dimensions having as many points as R² times three dimensions dimensional body, where we can see a number of infinity.

These are three important frequencies among chakras. You can see human body as more complex energetic structure than chakras, then the continous range of frequencies comes into play. You need one range of higher octave from bottom of root to top of the head; other smaller range from sexual organs to third eye (at those distances from the ground, they are located at the center line of human body); and additionally, left and right, front and back, infinities are formed. Right side and back form two dimensions of minus infinity; front and left side form plus infinity. So the human body is polarized in three dimensions. All the nuances in shape of human body have special spiritual meaning; the energies are felt as reaching outside of body – creating complex, direct functions between organs of humans. Third octave, reaching numbers higher than infinity, grows on this line outside human body – finally, it connects infinity with minus infinity at one point. These are three octaves and the upper and lower extremes always denote the same point, just as zero is always in the center; in every octave you can also see the angle between infinity and minus infinity – it’s infinitely long and at point, infinitely small (zero) angle. You can approach infinitely to infinity, but there is an imaginary point of limit theorem. When you take a limit of the whole function, not the last point, scaling it outwards and outwards and taking limit of this process for all the visible angles and their relations, finally you end up with infinite function on finite scale – the first half consists of finite numbers, whereas the second half is never actually reached; but you can see you reach a digit-preciseness at some point, so this is very close to infinity, and already vibrates infinite qualities and properties; for example, a civilization already vibrates some qualities, which could be attributes to infinitely many creative and good beings in the Universe – humans, aliens, all kinds of nations. They all are supposed to becomes unified as one – all the races, who adapt some religion (religion is a life theory, which is based on good and bad and makes such union possible). There are

enlightened minds in infinitely many civilizations of the Space. Three dimensions of human body also remain in higher-dimensional spaces – they are topologically identical to three-dimensional space.

**Infinity in reincarnations**

As you reincarnate, every infinity – every degree of infinity – is approaching, so you finally meet it.

In your life cycle, thus, infinitely small dimensions start to matter, which do not have a point value – their angle in point is zero; but as they have angle in infinity, they have an angle squared in a point; this I call upside-down U, which creates an angle when you look it from infinity. Thus, we

have to live by Theorem and Meaning, which fulfill such quality – but as space is reaching higher energy; two points at the extremes are actual infinities you can never reach when you go to future or backwards of time (ideals of infinity, which never reach in time as they are always in future or past, but they really exists on oracle and in memory as the limit values of the fractal pattern, concrete values becoming to be as they are repeated closer and closer) remains the same.

Let’s imagine the *outness* quality is universal – projected to the local point on hologram, octave down from infinity (human is one octave down, and particle of matter is two octaves, whereas subparticles are more octaves downwards). Now, outside the human body, those ideals are reached – crown and root chakra repeat their extremes in fractal pattern, which reaches outside of human body. In all three dimensions where human body creates symmetries or antisymmetries – left, right; up, down; front, back; they create an universal system of axes, which even exists in dimensions of Truth and Life force; thus, a human gets such structure of bodies for every plane it exists on. It exists as being composed of particles; being one physical body; and being an entity inside a larger whole or ecosystem. This three-dimensionality is repeated. Being higher or lower are very special and separate dimensions, and in this complex whole 7 more structured systems of frequencies appear – they make sense.

Outside your body upwards, you don’t see anymore that everything is one, but oneness of something bigger starts to see itself as multitude. You get going the grandest unified visions on these heights. Let’s imagine five elements of spirit, which unify three lowest chakras into one chakra, and cound otherwise from up downwards – this is the GNA code of Heaven, there must the heavenly matter reside by symmetry.

Outside your body downwards, you see structures so simple that they are outside you – cell qualities, they are inside your form, but atomic and subatomic particles are outside you in the direction of being many. As you align with this force, you open the root chakra outside your body – you open up the past, your family history, cell memory and the whole material complex of you for the change. As you get this balanced, your relation to matter and it’s ecosystem must become really good, and you are getting revitalized.

Some authors see those chakras outside the body as next chakras in the system; whereas most classical authors stick with the 7 and show how they grow themselves outside of body. This kind of thing is like using different words for the same thing.

Human body reflects the absolute number of qualities of creatures in the universe – these three dimensions make up a sphere, and this sphere itself is Truth of Multitude. These are the actual reasons behind the distribution of Life in Cosmos. As you grow outside your body, downwards you see also the constitution of matter – this is starting from your legs, and growing until it reaches the area below your body. Here, also the information gets dissolved into abstract units, which only together can give one truth. Upwards, infinitely large truth of reflection of universe of you, as you are a point hologram – containing the whole hologram, but not reproducing it with very good quality –, you start to see growing outside your body, how it seems a single aspect of wholistic truth from even higher sphere, where reality gets into one thing; there is only one Truth and One being in the middle. Let’s say, upwards and downwards you can go ¼ distance – after this, it becomes a personal and hidden thing for these creatures, yang principle – the male God – upwards, yin the female God or Holy Spirit downwards (as he is the matter, wholeness of the impermanent element),

and unmanifested God or the Trinity or Unity, this is where those two become one at other side of infinity.

Your chakras, where the smallest reaches the largest – several times – also unifies them into direct line – you can imagine an electromagnetic field, which is topologically the same; it makes up the whole sphere, but then connects the top and bottom points again into one, meeting itself like a Moebius Sphere. There is a good reason to think that the Space itself is a Moebius Sphere, and thus I have two zeros – the zero, it’s passed two times by this Sphere, inwards and outwards. Still, it grows down into repetition or fractal – yin has the repetition – and it grows up into one singleton element; outside, it is many points, which go through zero, and inwards the magnetic field simply let’s all points go through the zero – this is the oneness and multitude quality. Such qualities, reality loves to repeat everywhere.

**Infinity in Five Elements**

Additionally to your Seven Spiritual Elements, planes of Chakras, you can sense Five Physical Elements, known as Elements of Matter.

The infinity, for matter, is not so important – by all the combinations and truths, it only reaches to one Wholeness or Holiness quality, which connects all three higher Chakras. This frequency has one single top, one single infinity upwards. Lower, it has the same number of frequencies down to negative infinity.

**Infinity in Holy Trinity**

- God is the infinite; it’s the Oneness.
- Holy Spirit is the minus infinite; it’s the Multitude.
- Son or reincarnation of God is the Zero (Zero, on continuous scale, is one single unit – as you zoom infinitely in, which is needed by this operation of large infinities, you see one instead of zero; zero point becomes one discrete unit in the next octave closer; it’s still the Zero at the middle).
- In V letter I use in my math, which connects end of infinity to beginning of minus infinity, there should be the Trinity itself. It’s connecting the multitude into the singularity, and it passes through another zero; it thus closely relates the three qualities, which I intuitively would see really exist in this Nature.

For Wives of God – somehow the woman follows the quality of multitude, and it tends to appear that rather woman than a man is many, in relationship; so it’s one pattern repeated in some cultures – I would expect Holy Spirit appearing as many, but sometimes as one, and those many or this one – is the Daughter, creating female Trinity; catholic nuns call themselves wives of God, which is such symbolism. Humans, similarly, behave through smaller copy of this – they are one, part, and a composition.

**Infinity in Creation of Species, and in trinity of Hindu gods**

- The Creation, which is the positive, creative force which goes into design the descendants – this is actualized in higher organizational levels, where direct laws of particles and bodies

won’t happen, but the real force behind the universe – it’s Reason and Harmony – still apply as solid forces. This exists as strongly as the physical world of primitive properties of atoms, fields and whole systems. Mating psychology, culture of who would be more probably married, many high-level processes definitely controlled by mathematical laws about the physio-energetic systems; the Reason is the actual force behind anything, and this applies to both primitive – yin – processes and complex – yang – processes. Humans as a whole are no way outside the Laws of the Nature, but more complex laws hold as directly and materially, as the simpler laws hold in the direct process we can see and measure with simple machines. The Creation – all the high-level process you see involved, for example you are able to think in the physical world, which kind of child you want to get and thus, which kind of wife you want to marry, or which kind of plant you want to get and thus, which kind of plants you have to mix. Also, higher winds might blow this evolution – as stable, reliable laws of physics or rather spirit also hold in structured matter, and when you get them down into simple formulas, you would see the laws of physics and their interconnected wholes – repeated. Complex field patterns follow as solid and stable laws as single-number

frequencies, and as well are those referred as Laws of Nature. Here, we see the creative force – sex and love drive – acting as strong, irrational and almost all-controlling force, and this Love is the aspect of Creation visible to naked eye; indeed, yet higher levels of creation must happen. Also, the creative force is seen as the candidates of evolution appear – from complex fusion, they become the candidates of life, and this force as well is not destructive; we can see that by all means, it’s creative – it can use many forces, it has many possible combinations, and for mathematical fundamental this number of possible combinations is fundamentally very creative aspect of reality. This is the induction.

- There is a stable process which keeps the species alive, day to day, and this is very important in their existence, and how they are. They can willfully change this exact way how they are – and thus, which kind of creatures exist. This “higher gene” is free and changing – the culture. Animals have less of this element, and matter has even less (but it exists). This is Vishnu the preserver. This is the zero. This is the stability of existing species.
- The negative process of creation of the species is an evolution. It equals minus infinity – it’s negative by the false is unbecoming here, not the true becoming. This is Shiva the destroyer, and this is the force which destroys the false – thus, raising the density and cooperative force of the True, which exists as more. More and more subtle attributes start to do the selection of the species, or in case of choosing the survivors, not destroying the weaker – to do the selection of a culture (creating cultures of species, selected bloodlines, is slightly higher frequency than the older force of evolution, which simply undoes the wrong; in human existence, culture plays more and more central role, whereas the death is approximating to minimum). Evolution, as negative force, is still a thinking and living force – as the Cause and the Effect, the Karma of the evolution exists, so does it’s being; it slowly relates itself to it’s purpose and meaning and becomes conscious. This is the deduction.

Here we should see we should bless all the creative forces.

**Infinities in my own Logec (Logic)**

- Minus infinity is the Negotive: this is the Truth which holds now, but in infinity, it becomes

False. I use the letter I for it (I have several logic systems of those four letters, as the

meaning of them is deeper for me).

- Plus infinity is the Posetive: it holds now as truth, in our local calculation, but as the

calculation progresses, at some point it becomes false.

- V the V-Neuton, or unknown infinity: we do not know whether we finally get it true or false,

so we live in accordance to both possibilities.

- U is the Zero: it’s unknown, whether it’s true or false now, so we find out in time.
- Plus finity is the Position: It holds now.
- Minus finity is the Posetion: It does not hold now.

I have also another system of letters; here, the existence of axe is considered; I use T for local value

and R for position in infinity:

- I for Negotion, which is False, untrue, and it’s False in it’s own axe – R is Yes, it is on it’s

position, and it’s false; false at it’s correct position is false.

- O for Negation, which is False, but not in it’s value range or axe – as it’s value does not

happen, it’s not false, but true.

- A for Position, which is True, and on it’s own axe – as it’s true, and inside it’s range, it’s also

true in effect.

- E for Posetion, which is True, but not in it’s own range; for example it’s theoretically true,

but unachievable, better than you can do, or what you achieve in the future and not now. As

truth is not in it’s range, it’s a waste of energy and therefore false.

- Here, the bigger difference between IO and AE – this is the value, either negative or

positive, the value for R; IA and OE are locally down or up, this is the value of T – whether

their theorem holds or not. I say in infinity, false unbecomes – for example we learn from

this experience, this is our learning experience and thus negative, not negotive; whereas if,

in infinity, the true unbecomes – this is the false value, because it’s true, but does not happen

anyway, so by optimizing for this value we waste our energy.

- U, here (Neuton), is:

◦A: Either Negation or Position: it’s the true or false value still holding.

◦B: It’s the whole plane of logic growing upwards; the logical cause and effect getting a

new value by the logic doing a quantum leap; as theorems themselves change (or their

manifestations in reality), this is the positive process of reality growing upwards.

- V, here (V-Neuton), is:

◦A: It’s either false becoming to be in infinity, or true not becoming to be in infinity; this

combination of axe and operation gives false.

◦B: It’s the reality shifting in negative way: our system gets the new fundamental values,

but moving downwards. Unknown factors are the force, which leads to such change – as

unknown values become known, the whole reasoning of our logic changes; as new species and cultures evolve, their whole reasoning is different. Traitor, but also a person who wants to be your friend if you are rich, but enemy when you are poor – are examples of reality going down in such way that I use this middle point of posetive and negotive; those people give you posetive in case you are rich and negotive in case you are poor – inevitably making you poor, and thus also cutting their own monetary cycle with their karma.

- As meaning is infinite, sometimes I use them in sense that in case of negation, negative value does not mean a negative value; and in case of posetion, positive value does not mean a positive value – meaning appears in infinity.

Despite these Logec values being more like 6, and sometimes more, I call them four. Sometimes, to be like classical logic, I use only O and A – but classical logic is more like I and A. Turing and liers paradoxes, or which I call the truth-teller paradox (like people don’t give you money because you don’t have, or you not being hired because you don’t have an experience), this is the other paradox appearing – A => B and B => A, we see that those hold very easily of values A and B = True, or values A and B = False; we cannot solve this as logic, as both values are equally welcome to exist; despite we clearly imply something, but by this calculation, we cannot decide that one or another is true – as the formula gives true in any case (we don’t have a reason to choose). In such cases, sometimes we can choose the better possibility – but in some cases, it gives real, serious paradoxes; we assume something out of the life situation, as if it was truth itself, but by this, we actually create this truth, and thus we are getting nowhere further with Truth-teller paradox. Similarly, a program might halt only if it halts – it cannot, as well, say whether it halts. For halting program, it has to do the right choice – to avoid halting, it needs to not run if it’s halting in case it won’t halt, and maybe it could be run in case it’s not halting in case it’s not halting. The man who does not help himself in case somebody helps him, should also choose the right puzzle – to be helped at all. I think posetive and negotive as values from infinities help to solve those paradoxes; at least for myself, I have quite a clear picture – and I can say, they kind of happen in infinity. Four logecal values, they are not topologically identical to two – you don’t get the same combination when you try all the

combinations of logic and logec. Rather, the e leads to infinity, and the i does not. Infinity is seen in this logic, and solutions to turing’s and liers paradox, as when you have done the whole cycle and start again – at V – you pass the whole circle, the infinity; the nature of reality to repeat the cycle on higher levels – it’s related to a fact that the logic passes the infinity in such way. I think that if you use only true and false value, you really need an infinite amount of logic to achieve these results.

**Infinity in Meditation**

- Minus infinity is in the fact that as an observer, we do not force our thoughts to be positive – we let the negative cycles in ourselves do their process, and despite negative magic happens on all levels of our life, it would do it’s work. We don’t let this become the extreme, where it starts to destroy us – but as we become stronger, the negative process has to be let to meditation, where it achieves the light of consciousness and becomes an active unbecomer; in light of our consciousness, such minus force, lack of something, becomes a positive number – a position of unbecoming of this thing. Once we go through all the pain, the pain lives it’s own life – is a tricky, good-feeling, negative unbecomer, who looks for clever ways to die. It becomes a paradox that an everlasting death is it’s own life and creative force; to

do it’s thing, this force must attract negative elements into our lives. This is the evolution of our thoughts. This, like meditation, is connected to deduction – we achieve truth by undoing the false; we try all combinations and the theorems disprove the false.

- Plus infinity is the Vision, the Dream of the Future. It comes in many ways; we cannot fall into this positive negativity; we are warned to not fall into this – not to become idealist, dreamer, wishful thinker, or revolutionary personality –, but as much as we can tolerate, as this force operates on us, we align to move into the future, and our lives get permanent, healing qualities.
- Zero the balance. In meditation, we stay here and now – actually, our mind is supposed to be free, fearing us with negative and positive forces and possibilities; but we are circulating around which is really doable, which is the Vishnu force in Hinduism; we bring our attention to the presence, and we are not hurt by future being not there (it’s negative attribute) or the past being present (it’s negative attribute). I think there is a median point in being present and still letting the wide spectrum of forces to operate; but as we can discriminate, which are the Position, Negation, Posetion and Negotion: this, all those forces in effect, can still be expressed by existence of only the positive force, as they all do their own digit, and positive is positive, thus the one which holds in the process. Should we not see the Present, harmonic being, they are somehow unbalanced.

**Infinity in Human Learning and Growing**

- Minus infinity – we learn from mistakes, and we find things missing in our lives. This is the deductive process of growth. Also, method of doubt, or trial and error, leads here. This is the deductive process. It’s our genes, culture, the natural choice behind us.
- Zero – we keep the currently working cycle going on, and thus keep the tradition, the current state of affairs.
- Plus infinity – we go on with the processes, and imply better ends and means, we make innovation and improve; or we are creative. This is the inductive process. This is our love for the possible futures, the new connections we make, it’s some element growing in our souls.

**Infinity of rationality and irrationality**

- Minus infinity is irrational. It consists of small parts not yet giving true, but doing their complex patterns; it’s also a local value of truth constantly changing.
- Zero is the substantial truth, or a theory, which has some local value, but also means something as a separate whole. For example, the fact that we need to eat gives it’s own truth and is thus at the zero, but the fact that the noodles are on the table – it does not relate to whether we are hungry, so it’s an irrational element, it can change it’s value depending on what has really happened, and what happens. Single truths and theories go here, they form units.
- Plus infinity is the higher, wholistic truth: like Truth itself, or Love, or something higher which has such kind of qualities – always holding; wherever the evolution leads us – what remains, still has to follow such properties of higher truth. This kind of truth, which is

completely rational, is not changing in time; still, it’s unfolding, and the same words once said might mean a lot more – for example if I say, “what you do needs to come from heart”, the sentence word-by-word holds for future creature, as he has this frequency, but what he would do from his heart – I can not imagine this. So we also need to know the particulars. I can further assume that the basic fact about truth and lies would, for a future creature, go together much as mine. Still I feel I have invented something higher than goodness and logic, but somehow, by going to very end with goodness and logic – it would still hold in infinity. I think, infinity gives us something more.
