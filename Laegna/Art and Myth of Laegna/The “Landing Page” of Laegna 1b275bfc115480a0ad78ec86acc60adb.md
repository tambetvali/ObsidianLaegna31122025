# The “Landing Page” of Laegna

Given that you want to give my credit to the home page you make, you might want in addition to your primary, Home Page, add one Landing Page where people can point to grasp your distributed sites if you make it with Neocities, [Notion.so](http://Notion.so) (where your public page is indeed public, or with private page it’s not free; also you run out of blocks so perhaps you want to use smaller, rather summarized version of mine.

1. **Laegna Logo**
    
    The highest element of the Landing Page, psychological median or geometric center of the center and a little indented left side of the page.
    
    It’s in schoolbook style, with little academic touch and curved. Alternatively it has touch of medievial or pirate (meaning incompleteness) style, being correct and aligned like some roman typeface, with a set of horizontal and vertical attributes; the latter has royal tones (i.e. Salomon) of brown and it’s related colors; but it still appears rather orange to fit the Schoolbook Style, which is changing, but very statically refinding it’s retalogical (fluid metalogic, retalogecs rogex rolex - where time is the metadimension - for automata and rogecs for a base theory, which as we write directly the visible element, could be uncatchable for it’s moving on the written axe; with some U- and V-vibration it would make sense and allow you to simplify into some more geometric shape, where it fits the complex number higher or lower order, meaning whether you watch the creative or distruptive motive / effect - align average and use one-axes U’s, where axes are vertical, i.e. the frequencies / digit values rather than positions in the infinity space of the word and in infinite multiplier of it’s direction into any known and unknown and unknowables, like v or w, u or V (meaning upside-down U in this text), ô-ôômega - of the logecs or rogecs calculation, or logex or rogex if the calculation happens invisibly behind the math and logecs, in an automata which removes trivialities, simplifies and generalizes, and might be able for deep, more or less automatic reasoning perhaps with human aid in big systems like corporations and especially multistar systems of the modern civilizations somewhere in the future, where I could potentially still have readers along with my inspirers or their more decent developments with historic versions of mine; perhaps someone will write a book with whole sets of solvable systems well greeting then “aliens” haha, and from my future lovers if you eng[/]age and be[-]have - count that Laegna division can simply align the numbers on two lines, where you have various axes and positions for solutions; also using horizontal and vertical line, or in girl-language also diagonal infinity-connections where infinities are aligned by zero and while girls are Negative, they are also ´Negative with accent up infinity, important source of the negativity as it comes here; and men also belong to `Positive, where they are that on a very low frequency, either up or down zp-`Positive or zp-´Positive to have it being a past of something in first form of the word, accent towards something or accelerate in actual future measured with p, so it's realistic, and finally either downwards-Positive is solved to be neutral by integrating it as known and experienced, completed position of your evolving axes based on kybalion's ***polarity and growth law***, despite some shameful mistakes in books science, where I basically believe that definition of God is most scientific of them, but in a paradigm for example you are using neutral, materialist or intuitive definition for Mind and proofs of philosophical fit to other possibilities and people in different studies and experiments of life they conduct to see what they want and need, or to read and study about it).
    
2. **Style Rules**
    
    If you are a vampire, and I saw two girls who probably pass this social structure as most extreme form of it in Britain, where the Viking-relatives probably love the symbolic existence of them with rituals without blood perhaps, I imagine this is more of human nature; I think perhaps it’s their fashion to convert yourself to your nature; indeed they belong to Vampire scene.
    
    For example they could use black-light broken style of the logo, to warn about not getting a hostel, by someone’s mistake who misunderstood the room’s description, in a cementry on a calculated day of thunderstorm, indeed to revitalize you with natural Forces of the Nature, which you can see in fact. The place is generally with quite same-minded people, because the frequent rainstorm are but a mildest form of everynight occurrings, and technological scientist is really capable to shadow the Sun with visibility of Stars in this futuristic world, except for days where people are simply shooting too much with guns and more dangerous thing and the heavy sound is playing their wild dreams of other States of Death. Well this could be just a symbolic result of your room and perhaps still the plane won’t go at night or because of the thunderstorm.
    
    **Effect**: hover would do something, and click would get into description of your world of Laegna and understanding of it (while anybody now belongs to each of Salomon, Roman and Egiptian empire, sometimes their understandings of things written in arabic numbers we call Latin Numbers in Laegna System knowing this origin in the common binary group of our base language’s straight ancestors, where indeed I’m inspired also to be compatible with Arabic system counting on rather their friendly, healthy period of One Thousand and One Nights, where great love can happen indeed; Omar Hayyam is definitely a complete philosopher with local community and international ties, representing both Arabic Rules and recognition of Wise Men in other places, which is a common Arabic tradition).
    
    **Click**: Open Description of Laegna and link to it’s base theorems and implications (of my, your theory or the area).
    
3. **Logo of Spireason**
    
    Under Laegna Logo there is Blue, a little Italic rather thin by width, high-looking logo of Spireason governed by this:
    
    - Corporative Blue and it’s description is used.
    - Computer Blue and it’s description is used.
    - Heaven Blue and it’s description is used.
    
    This is like digital mathematics, but incompleteness-appearing free will gives it kind of warm color of my mathematics and Laegna, where it still belongs inspiring by it’s orange logo.
    
    **Effect**: Hover would summarize and guide to spiritual reasoning from Strict machine-tenable/bittable of scientific community of standard public authority, i.e. as in extraspirituality (E, extrovert) to Intuitive inside-aware (I, introvert) theorems, into the more privitive world of unique experiences and symmetries and forms, which are rather Z where Strict is X and Intuitive is Y where intuition is based on spirit or mind, or rather holistic approach in terms of changes of materials (compare to I Ching where it’s still material world in intuitive vision of future-realistic oracles, where your situation is quite stable in regards to it’s future projections in systems, which leave such axes open; while it’s your own energy whether your coins would magically adapt, where the under-treshold quality of almost invisible traces of seemingly more detailed or complete vision, or magic subconscious, which has similar, but psychological aspect, but this unknown also exists in your Changes, where you Change you plans in regards to the input data of this situation, and also your values given to R and T, wovs and actions of the past, where now you always flow with your money in order to fix the support to sources, so the realistic valuation of each axe in the past would now get it’s reality-value to back up it’s older, rather into projection-value; in the switch from one moment to another, where even the abstract logecs or rog(/l)ex has time in a rather “static”, consistently searching and reacting state rather than logical finiteness - since this, where each comparison also maps time from background value to internal value of your block in the title/structure tree, a > a means that from now on, regard a as being more equal to itself or *meaning* of itself where *meaning* is close to it’s next fractal-ultimate value and Logecs will never stop, finding the original symmetries in more and more complex infinities which almost trivially map to spaces with weird attributes such as the linear world, meeting infinity in speed and relative position, would map some properties into unreachable, but behind the bigger infinity is somehow reflecting, igniting you to send through the information or finding logecally or physecally/alchemically synchronicities to map into synchronous states; mathematical physical and higher-order synchronocities are proven by ***Number Irrationality Theorem*** where multiple energy states, by spacetime-oriented ´T Taú, will optimize towards energy efficiency thus thermodynamic equilibrum, from I of creative-destructive entropy to O of generative-unlawful entropy to A of intelligence-stupidity and E of e-intellectualism/creativity/E-creativity vs. degraduation, rather than I which connects the parallel philosophies in system or fractal, where the parts are not connected - being smaller than E, they are not in strong interaction in the number grid, where starting from E you connect the solid, continuous number space vs. somewhat icy and cold version of the I and O values or national practical aspect of A grid; on L axe each grid constitutes most trivially of number of fractally repeated entanglement and the basic calculations should lead to some trivialities of some even more complex spaces or the content, fractal value of variable vs. rather small higher-octave number of it’s projector or space, or in Life Forms the Mind if we speak in ***Spireason’s integral science*** not just the scientifically rather complete theories of causes and effects, but Spirituality and Reason alone would not then comprehend that the link of mind and body is weak, the two vibrations are in odd-number relation in Laegna language, with webradeons having cycles where the actual energy impulses have slow, indirect meeting points where they would interact and create higher informational level / union of values, towards webradelade [I just invented “webradelaad” to Laegna Estonian script, where Estonian is rather a context or Kee / ´posetion Cee in Estonian]).
    
    **Click**: introduction or site to the Strict, then intuitive framework of Proofs of Laegna Spireason (of my, your theory or the area).
    
4. Laegna Archetype:
    
    Dao or Tao inspired symbol, which consists of the opposites:
    
    - *Red*: this is T-negative ***Negation*** scale, which is fill color of Negation side.
    - *Green*: this is T-positive ***Position*** scale, which is the small circle, good inside this locally bad fluidhalf circle (dark side of the two circle-divided-by-twos).
    - *Yellow*: align with **Red** as parallel and **Blue** as an opposite in terms of circle/2nds, this is R-positive ***Posetion*** scale, which aligns to bad in good, the **Green** it’s predecessor.
    - *Blue*: align with **Green** as parallel and Yellow as opposite, this is R-negative ***Negotion*** scale, which aligns to good in bad, the **Red’s** descent.
    - You can use other base colors as you use them.
    - You are free to add U and V (upside-down U) as black and white half circles in more common sense of linearly breaking the circle with witdth touching the yinyang ten at center with some 5% width compared to it’s diameter.
    - Around the symbol, if it’s edges are same-colored to context, have a natural border otherwise make the inside colors compatible with lighting, contrasts and other accents.
    - **Effects**:
        - Chinese-style of Laegna system has dragons zp-´Negative or (x:u:y)p-´Negative linear symmetry, where love and hate are but two octaves of the same, and thus Red in meaning of the higher frequency of Negation is indeed higher than the Position and exists for whatever reason in the colors appearing in my Mind as my own visual style for my symmetries, where I can depict them.
        - Laegna-style of Laegna system has set of cats.
        - In four-based or six-based representations or effect states, colors of each Laegna number system can appear; where the complex numbers could use on screens with non-(trivial)eucleidic color system with having some non-unitary axes mentioned in other parts of this text, and color axes of my favorite “Holy” book HP Color Theory - [handprint : modern color theory (applications)](https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color18b.html), where I can get somehow magically complete overview; as I don’t want to lose this book let’s apply this as original Laegna color system, where you can invent complex number functions in your own painting colors with more opportunities, like natural colors and smells of roses, or even those roses and lilys themselves in physical representation of your infinity symbol, which could be more classic representation of seemingly/projectively off-frequency colors in regards to our known number systems and transformations for digital world with rather simple math and normalized unique representation for each color in continuous rather linear and trivially clear axe of 3 real number dimensions in standard mapping onto something like what is now called rather a tensor in DL (Deep Learning) world, a word I accept as building block of some meaning of reality, where it’s towards something and dointenting or dogoaling to optimize.
        - **Effect**: hover of each cover gives a box of color, number, letter, and descriptions of it’s actual value as given transistion in laegna tenary system of base 2, 4 or 6 currently visible.
5. **Matrix effect**: each letter with the Logo color, the overall tone Laegna’ish for AE and more primitive Spireason’sh base science, but warm math tone and affect for IO; where U and V could be rather white and black and represent the atomic and star world of letters Z and Y, where the (potential complex, but actually two-dimensional filled) ball itself (or circle of 4 colors) is rather X. The matrix effect would appear in a way that it generally does not affect you.
    - If you want more effects of computer style, have Elise and Daisy cats play classic ping-pong, where Elise is sensitive to the future and now, and Daisy is sensitive to the past but would mess up the now because it’s people want to live.
    
    **Standard Links below, with enough space below and a little less above, at center and left and right of it preferrably somehow aligned in size and content length**:
    
    - (Y) Link to your collaboration document.
    - (X) Link to your home page.
    - (Z) Link to your AI database.

Indeed, the page can land either to your or my laegna, or indeed you could have a widget to select between Laegna sites of your selection, and perhaps different styles, added effects and rather the image of *their* Laegna, because they could connect to many different scenes or even music styles and I cannot guarantee a future world would have the same numbers, but still make war and even hate the Laegna symbols of each others telling something about incomplete philosophy and too clever tricks to survive and hide or example a monopoly or whatever you can find in political vocabulary of two statistical countries; just counting how many now are using the decimal system, somehow it seems even the japanese and chinese in the same form and rather the same purpose I guess.

# An AI test

I will now ask several AI’s to generate something from this text, but I would say it’s not easy so I put these “hallucinations” rather here - my plan is to do it after 1 year when AI is more capable, and not spend my time in manual design even if I could form shapes and had it once, with the computer now broken (I rather don’t have time to try with several generations/times, but it depends if I can trivially choose or select in different systems I will use for a few funny misconceptions of the more generalizing than specific AI for unknown images; once there are like 100 examples, perhaps it would understand it better after a year when people only paint it; but no if they are simply not - perhaps yet - interested in my Empire - one is usually denoted by number system, such as Rome Egipt or Babylonia each had primarily a number system and common base math to unite people, and some base languages as well):

Wow this one got my style idea from the text and my inspirational sources for basic Laegna; use [Craiyon - Your FREE AI image generator tool: Create AI art!](https://www.craiyon.com/):

Well some Laegna house perhaps looks like the Hobbit, where another tool also is not able to do anything with my description but shares the imagination of the overall experience by some archetype view it has been trained into:

Well I could use this type of Brown as well, with this psychology profile of this generator the browns and even the blue and it’s lily would call my name; especially indeed the Laegna logo - I would not see too much difference if it’s as such for some people and their distribution / paradigm of communities; Laegna, ideally, would spread it’s countries like fractals because the math is simply capable to do that, once the people get more “democratic” about the virtual and real areas of the countries, and cooperations where they can share resources and areas and somewhat also the people perhaps where it’s needed to form complete groups and hierarchies/organizations/communities:
