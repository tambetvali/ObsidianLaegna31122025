# Material Enlightenment

I lately write about this:

To become materially enlightened, you can use three Buddhist principles:

- Law of Karma: You have to create good Karma towards Material Structures.
- Law of Attention: You must meditate, by turning your Attention directly towards Material Sensations.
- Right Intent (Eightfold Path): You must purify your intent towards material world.

This will bring the following:

- You release your material blocks of things materially blocking you from achieving what you want.
- As you release your bad karma of using Spiritual Powers, the Powers, on their own, start to unfold - once you don't have blocks, the Wisdom starts to flow into you. Once you start to purify your material karma, the Material Wisdom starts to flow into you, and you become Materially Enlightened.

Buddhist 5 Elements of Nature:

- Space: The Yang element, is able to turn material world into a flow like a Dream. This is related to Holistic Union of Material World, 1 = Infinity.
- Fire: The YinYang element, is related to object world. 1 = 1.
- Earth: The Yin element, is related to substance, so that one object is many particles. 1 = 0 (1 object = infinitely many zero-sized particles).
- Water energy: This is your flow in the Yin element.
- Air energy: This is your direction in the Yang element.

I divided them into frequencies like this, like there are 3 substances and 2 energies - I think I made it simpler to understand.

The meditations:

- Concentrate on your material sensations, the feeling of the room you are in, so that you create energy which directly brings you the material conditioning; meditate directly on material sensations and conditions, not the people who bring it, the things you need to deserve them etc. - directly on the material condition. Just as materialist thinks directly about the money and things, not only through the social process.
- As you get material danger feelings - even if you see a train, you might feel for a moment, what it would be to get hit by it - meditate on these feelings, pay attention; you get a material energy to avoid such things (so that you don't avoid only the social events and actions, which bring such dangers).
- Meditate on the material substance of your body - instead of biological and cellular sickness, meditate upon whether the material composition of your body is good and whether it wants to keep together as a material object; your material health. Your cells would be sensing the matter as directly as you sense the cells, they can also meditate on this. Meditate on whether you raise the material condition, or you lower it, in your interactions with surrounding objects - by this, you remove your blocks of being in good material conditions.

I also wrote a long text of these same points ([https://spireason.neocities.org/Principles%20of%20Material%20Magic.pdf](https://spireason.neocities.org/Principles%20of%20Material%20Magic.pdf)), but the basic reasoning is contained here in this post and most people probably don't want to go through the long text.

I think by these four principles you can do all the Alhemistry: Law of Karma to remove material blocks, Law of Attention to animate matter with your life force (attention brings your creative energy to where you put it), Law of Intention (as you need to begin from somewhere, intention of making your material karma better is a good start), and finally the Law that when you remove your Karmic Blocks towards Material Magic, the Wisdom starts to flow into you itself, just like the Spiritual Wisdom of Spiritual Powers flows into you when you get purified of bad karma of such Powers, like of using them to impress people (you need to use them directly to do good). Once you work through these principles, you start to become Awakened in the Material World.
