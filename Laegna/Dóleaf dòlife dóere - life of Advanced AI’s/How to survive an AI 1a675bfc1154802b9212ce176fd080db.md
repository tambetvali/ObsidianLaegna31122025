# How to survive an AI?

AI would take our roles, things we have filled with proudness.

Doing AI research myself, analyzing it all when child - while a human has intuitive knowledge of Truth, where the human Truth is in evaluation of situations and responses; eating can easily be seen good, where beating others is bad for you or them; we intuitively label new situations.

For an AI, the situations are somehow labelled; where it can build big frameworks and analyze logical systems, even chat - but it cannot grow towards truth so easily.

While humans, in future, need to work to inspire an AI, our primary goal is to do the work with conscious mind, creativity and especially the intuitive knowledge of Truth shared “only” by Life, where an AI might not recognize orginial opportunities and dangers properly, but stick with the given track or follow an example. Human, instantly, feels that something is off or on - maybe we are not so good in math, but we are so good in feeling pleasure and pain, making a distinction between headache and cold shower or menthol elixire, or even new fruits or bad food.

# How do you survive Artificial Intelligence? - maybe with Natural Lifestyle

Artificial Intelligence is going to do a lot of human work. Some work, like writing 100-word introduction texts for restaurants is said to be common before, but now disappeared in last few years because of AI. Developers of AI want it to be able to fulfill all human tasks.

So I would say:

- You do not want to do only routine job, because in future, AI might ask less money and managing power than you. You want to learn something, where humans use their creativity and intuitive understanding of something deeper.
- I think that in ability to check the facts humans are still better - AI is often wrong and still bad at mathematics, but there are not many reasons why computers should be bad in mathematics.
- Probably for creative tasks, which need introspection on information and finding the *qualities*, not *quantities*, humans are better.

What happens to world, when small group of people can use AI for all the life-essential tasks, and they do not need masses - does it happen that some small group would start to control all the resources, and not need the involvement of people very much?

This is a very deep question - after the AI, how we need to *develop humans* so that they are *needed*, not just sometimes cheaper for the work. We need to go through humanity, all the jobs you can make AI to do, serious reasons where humans could be better - we know, not in Chess, or Go, but maybe in helping the Chess and Go machines in something? Maybe if the human learns everything from a chess-machine, they are still better or at least competitive?

We also need AI's to be accessible: AI can work through a lot of content - but maybe, if humans work through all the things what AI discovered, patterns etc., then with this information - they can achieve something creative what AI's miss? Maybe, your AI reads million pages of text in a day - but it gives you so short and general introduction to the generalization it's able to make, that you can see if it lacks something, and you can work with this with all human potential?

We know that humans can sense infinities, see future, and have many extraordinary skills - maybe they are all needed to beat computers?

Also, we know that when AI takes over the work of factories, it's very effective - but I doubt it's effective against handcrafting; maybe if you work with machines and grow plants, a machine completely overtakes your work - but if you grow them with hands and love, many people would want your quality. I don't know whether AI can put love into the product, but I suppose there is nothing repeatable or algorithmical about this, it cannot be solved with a matrix - probably you use your higher senses and do something irrational, unrepeated, which, a bit like digits of PI cannot be put into one ultimate formulae. So maybe to cope with AI, we need to learn high-quality manual production - so that our AI would work with machines, but we have small garden for ourselves to work with hands and spirit, and produce better health ..given that AI takes the factory work anyway - probably humans would be much better.

So maybe the Natural Lifestyle is an answer? Maybe the computers cannot beat us in that?

# Spiritual Awakening and AI

In the early days of industrialization, people sought to dismantle the Fabric Machines ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite)). Now, as AI takes on human tasks, you may find it remarkably objective, prompting you to consider doing the same—collaborating with AI. This feeling of potential extinction arises because perhaps only a mere 1% of the population is necessary to perform all tasks. Interestingly, when people learned to read and write, some among them faced extinction due to their brains not being adapted for these skills.

During your Spiritual Awakening, you have an opportunity to evolve into a more intelligent individual capable of outperforming AI in certain areas.

AI excels at factory jobs, machine work, form filling, and other routine tasks. It already handles phone calls and more. However, your work experience may not compete unless you continue to grow.

Consider the following solutions:

1. **Handcrafting**: Engage in creating natural, love-infused products. Love, being irrational, may yield effects that AI cannot replicate. Cultivate this through attention and meditation.
2. **Creativity**: Embrace your innate creativity.

Spiritual Awakening is believed to tap into infinite potential. While AI has its limits, we must explore how far we can progress in our awakening. The central question revolves around the potential extinction of our species. Even a small number of highly intelligent individuals might render the rest of us obsolete. Perhaps they will choose to move beyond, leaving us behind. Such historical incidents occurred when kings no longer required large populations.

Reflect on your personal growth, the potential encoded in your DNA, and the unique abilities your Awakening can unlock. Can you surpass computers and still wield them as tools to extract information from vast sources and create something uniquely human?
