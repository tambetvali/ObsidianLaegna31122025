### **5. Example Workflow for Theory Builders**

1. **User selects a scenario**: Let’s say the user is integrating **Laegna axioms** into their theory. They opt for **Theory Integrator Mode**.
2. **Bot presents axioms**: The bot provides a set of **Laegna axioms** for integration and asks about the user’s **existing framework**.
3. **User inputs theory**: The user pastes their theory or key sections.
4. **Bot analyzes and suggests improvements**: It identifies sections that would benefit from the inclusion of **Laegna axioms** and presents **proof templates**.
5. **User refines theory**: The bot helps integrate and check for logical consistency, suggesting **simplifications** or **mathematical proofs** where needed.

### **6. Conclusion: Customization and Precision**

This **Theory Builder Bot** is fully customizable based on the user’s specific needs. It adapts to those who are working with **automated data**, writing **encyclopedic definitions**, building **theories with Laegna axioms**, or composing **introductions** to integrate **Laegna** into existing works. With the **KISS principle** in mind, the bot ensures users receive only the information they need, without excess, providing a streamlined path toward advancing their theory.
