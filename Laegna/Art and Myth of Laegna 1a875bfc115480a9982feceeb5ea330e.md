# Art and Myth of Laegna

# Laegna Logo

Yinyang symbols, where:

Yin, O, is Red

Yang, A, is Blue

Yin in Yang, I, is Yellow

Yang in Yin, E, is Blue

Around there is a cirle, one side black (U, connected to Yin, V, connected to Yang).

A custom borders can be used in regards to background color, pattern or image, so that it has definite shape and does not blend into anything.

Taoist animations are cool and they can be developed to reflect Laegna mathematics rather than direct yinyang contemplation.

Symbolic meaning: I contemplated on paradox, definitely the resolution of Tao, before I reached the more scientific and less symbolic Laegna numbers to involve my resolution of paradox. Later, I found out it’s definitely four as in I Ching, but not one symbol or some examples, but as a logecs basic Truth value.

To respect chinese, dragons, for Laegna either Red and Blue, or in all 4 colors, or in all 6 colors with black and white represented on Logo, also in alignation with numeric, symbolic and linguistic meaning of the letters. Instead of dragons, there can be two cats Elise and Daisy, or more cats like 4 or 6 as there are actually more.

# Laegna Mascots

Red cat, called Elise and often hand-drawn, who represents the mathematics of the Universe, or the Universal Love (especially in context of scientific love, or synergy and integration, which happens in positive Universal math). This is the Good Mascot of Laegna; Conus or Cosinus (if they are seen equal, there are only two mascots which is the basic of Laegna, actually there are many mathematical archetypes in effect). This is induction: more truth based on truth.

Blue cat, called Daisy and often hand-drawn, who represents the opposite force; as each mistake and minus number of the universal logic starts to appear, becomes more conscious or has indirect effect, daisy is in action. This is the Evil Mascot, the Sinus; he finds out he exists, about which he happily says he “died” (which is his version for being born), and since there is no valid argument or rule to remove him, he is rather tricky force of a seeming demon, using complex and clever, long ways to actually die (or in this sense, to be born, which is while he has resolved itself into non-existence). Daisy, rather than letting your real death close to you, plays your kind of deaths and problems catfully and delicately, looking like warm ice of funny, unconscious and absolutely foolish feeling and using the words of stupid masses or criminal minds, but in paraphrases so that they would make some sense - but they don’t make sense if you think positively, you have to, in addition to your positive pursuit, also avoid the negative and understand avoiding without going through it, is a cramp - you cannot do this forever, you must go through cycle at least mentally; in some sense, any bad in Universe is as such; it starts from I, actual failure, but becomes O, the resolving acceptance and understanding of this failure to live out of it through some experience and fear where there was blind and not very straight way which seemed straight without daisy, leading to death in “infinity” (long term).

# Laegna Myth

Well as I am Buddist, as a slogan for “Laegna Empire” (the people who can use logecs and spireason, perhaps my future works and their own future works extending and aligning with it) I just stole the Japanese slogan: “Land of the Rising Sun”, because I love the song and the old Sun, definitely, is starting to behave very coldly with us.

I invented “Laegna Ship”: this is a ship bringing us to more conscious future, where infinite values and integrated truth is more common, and instead of seeing every day the fall of the sun, every day we would see rise of the sun.

Laegna God: while myself is there, but when it gets into the culture, many people are involved and rather, for each thing to spread and leave a trail, in some aspect “God” is creating it; so, to explain the problems - they are problems of Laegna God - and solutions - solutions of Laegna God; with such entity we get a coherent story, about how the Universe felt and ended, and He created a new one able to survive, facing death himself. Japanese story **Seven Gods of Fortune** (Shichifukujin) is the example, where Laegna God is one of 7 Gods on the ship, perhaps sitting in the front, but perhaps not exactly the same God (Ebisu) - I rather like the form, and the Japanese style, and to represent Laegna randomly as huge, modern ship of our actual world or this little boat of Gods, where all the complexities and nuances of society are rather simple, plain physical things perhaps hard to explain. Rather, with universal Laegna Ship - in realm of Gods, it looks like a little boat like this, and Gods know where they are heading. The case is - while my story is complex, the God directly feeling the universal problem in middle of time, very precisely as Laegna system not the complex reality, and resolving it, having every love and conflict which would appear for me in long time, perhaps after my death - that’s what the God should be doing. Haha 😊

# Laegna Text Logo

Brownish, orange or red, in wide letters of school style, a little academic perhaps - it looks like a textbook text for children. It’s rather a mathematical system.

# Spireason’s Text Logo

It’s of blue or blueish color, a little bit like the color symbolizing computer text of console, even by form as the letters are thin (left to right) and appear a little digital. Still, it’s not very digital and kind of warm when compared to this computer thing, and it might be a little italic but it might be also very straight. It connects spirituality with reason, so it’s not completely “digital format” of some console, which is rather reason, but the spiritual is also kind of blue, with kind of high letters.
