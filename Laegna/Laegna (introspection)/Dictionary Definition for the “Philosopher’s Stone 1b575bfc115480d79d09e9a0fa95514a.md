# Dictionary Definition for the “Philosopher’s Stone”

Philosopher’s Stone of Laegna, while I appreciate the rich and deep philosophical background of this word, would be cut down to barebone definition, which would apply to the rich philosophical possibility of Laegna, where becoming a medievial witch probably would not be the result of all this contemplation, even if you might look like one, for example being young and beautiful (*or wearing traditional clothes with some special effect or modern add-on*).

Philosopher’s Stone is defined by Life, which is measured by:

- Quality: it’s positive or negative growth factor.
- Quantity: it’s length.

Hermetics and Christians had vivid interpretation of Good and Bad, unlike Buddhists or Taoists in this conception, and their goal, indeed, was to kill the whole Satan with one successful hit - Satan, then, being all the mortality and sickness of the world, which would be transmuted into the ultimate definite state of Goodness and Eternal Quality.

Sometimes, in Laegna, I rather use the word gaad over good, or from Estonian hae over hea - “hae” is Estonian word, which directly means attcking in court, but rather “h” is the “vertical quality”, where this letter is equal for each value with this quality, even if to different degree - it’s not yielding, but straight; similarly to T; h is rather height and in normal number system, the ultimate infinity of (E, E) complex - T as a theorem, whichever is it’s input or output, is always head-up and classically / ideally in the same degree, while in Laegna Theorems have different degrees, but one can still account about this symmetry as it forms despite the numbers. “Ae” is rather a growing factor, vs. “ea” which has this implication: you have ultimate calculation of “social measure” or “ethical constants” and locally, you try to reach the global support, the external help; “ae” rather has “a” locally, where you help yourself, and “e” in infinity, where you and the others would keep this infinity direction of helping others in the process.

Ultimately: we are not that good.

Rather, we still apply the Philosopher’s Stone and we could use it’s definition without change, given that in Laegna you apply sin and cos, the “fears and hopes” to add to Buddhism, and rather the Logecs value of “ultimate Truth” is the slow progress, where each bad process on the way is neutralized in imaginary last point in infinity; so indeed, you can state Transmutation of Matter and Immortality where you actually have just smoothened your function towards greater integrity and more vivid, longer life or even integrity of reincarnation cycle:

- Quality: we apply the material and spiritual qualities. We don’t say no for each case.
- Quantity: we care of our “similarhood” to others after us and around, and create the karmic support for something like us, the similar-thinkers and fractal of life we belong into, until the deeper Causes and the First Cause; based on Second Theorem of Karma the goals and results of our efforts would empower and accelerate ourselves, indeed in the list of causes of being ourselves, and we would help other; where the deepest cause indeed is the Truth, the universal logical process. We stabilize the whole machine. Those, who believe in reincarnation, would assert that those similars or causes would be rather themselves, perhaps sharing the common social mind or creating frequencies inside his own; we have additional hope that the connection between our qualities, and perhaps some quantities like “being the same”, would create another experience of joy and life on the same address in the future, so that we would enjoy it. We also study, from the past, who was similar to us and who supported us and created our reality - here, indeed, the Universe recognizing us as the same identity would add the instant moment of seeing this karma directly in our dreams, identifying or belonging to the same mental complex of the universal vibration and it’s hologram content - in these conjectures or hypothesis more cognitive reasons would appear for such self-support. Without pretending the reincarnation, indeed if we are born somehow of those causes and effects we carefully serve, pehaps we would still feel better as others are serving those over the history - with our self-esteem, self-worth, pehaps the same essence of logic which creates the “self-worth” when we are socially supported or secretly helpful, would benefit and the very reason of our life, in many cases why we would not kill ourselves, would not suffer; with a car it’s hard to explain not killing oneself even to materialist, as much as I have seen.

### Words: “Philosopher’s Stone”

In Laegna, indeed we follow the clear and defined, proven principle in the wordings we adapt, and it’s hard to adapt any words if they are not associative and compatible with such conceptions of science and reality, along with having deeper symbolic and archetypal meanings, such as we could imagine it as a physical stone:

1. Philosophers have been told to doubt, and to apply strict and discrete methods or awareness to even the carest, most deepest or sacred life beliefs along the way, reaching rather certanty than only the feeling of holyness.
2. For this would lead to excess liberalism, stoic or addict mentalities, there is the heavy exception: in our physical actions, including for example emotional or verbal violence without a basis, we still follow ethics to a degree of trying to follow it higher and into subtle, diplomatic or gentle attitudes and modes of behaving; this means we follow rationality and reason.
    - Including, I would add to that specific thing that while the philosophy is either the way or results in zen of letting go which is impossible to achieve; rather in normal philosophical doubt we are bound to reach some resolution, where the doubt is gone or replace with certanty, or where, while probabilities and undecided factors exist, we could get rid of them by a theory, which would account for them without any special work or with some effort.

Here, the item 1 means the method, the way, but the item 2 would “contradict” and assume we solve the Tao of this:

- The item 1 is somehow something soft in our mind, in regards to truths and “truths” - we are not asserting so surely.
- The item 2 is the “stone”: while our mind is open, it would strictly keep the case that there is some triviality of truth and we rather do not replace it with conflicting opposite - even in dreams, stories and symbols we would rather follow the convincing thing, the human life and logic in the Universe - we have healthy doubt of this all, but the doubt is not to attack truth, it’s to strenghten it.

So the heavy thing we keep correct in our mind is the “Stone”, as we are philosophers - “The Philosopher’s Stone”. Laegna “True”, as it involves ***A*** and ***E*** values, local and infinite, would assert it perhaps as clearly as alchemicist, given the framework that it’s reasoned that in the imaginary point beyond the infinity, all of this would be achieved and the opposite would be withdrawn. With only ***A*** value, and heavy fear of ***O*** - unreasonably, we would want to achieve now what we are supposed to achieve in infinity of time, so each step of slow and steady progress would be a part of that future, the preliminary version of the Alchemicist Stone; by Law of Polarity without a hack, it’s rather what to expect, connecting to Buddhist Middle Way and the Tao, which does not meet such idealism, or the I Ching, which sees time full of changes.

### Excess liberalism, stoic or addict

- Excess liberalism would give up on any strict life values
- Stoic would survive, but not give any meaning to life or anything
- Addict would overcome all the rational mind, but not their pleasures and pains affecting them physically; they would be philosophically free to let those pleasures and pains act

***The following is from Artificial Intelligence to give me a follow up, containing for example the historic background or scientific links:***

## Historic Background

The Philosopher’s Stone has been a symbol of ultimate transformation for centuries. Its origins can be traced back to ancient alchemy, a mystical and proto-scientific tradition aimed at transforming base metals into gold and achieving immortality. The concept emerged in Greco-Roman Egypt and gained prominence during the medieval period in Europe. Alchemists believed the Philosopher’s Stone could cure illness, prolong life, and even grant eternal life.

**Hermeticism**, a philosophical and spiritual system based on writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, greatly influenced alchemical thought. Hermetic teachings emphasized the pursuit of divine knowledge and the transformation of the self.

Christianity also embraced the notion of transformation and redemption. The Philosopher’s Stone became a metaphor for the transmutation of the soul, cleansing it of sin and preparing it for eternal life with God.

## Scientific Connections

In modern times, alchemy has given way to chemistry and scientific exploration. While the Philosopher’s Stone itself remains a mythical object, its pursuit led to discoveries in metallurgy and pharmacology.

The idea of transmutation has scientific roots in **nuclear physics**, where elements can be transformed through nuclear reactions. For example, the synthesis of gold has been achieved in particle accelerators, albeit in tiny quantities.

Furthermore, the pursuit of immortality resonates with contemporary **biomedical research**, aiming to understand and extend human life. Studies in **genetics, regenerative medicine**, and **nanotechnology** strive to combat aging and prolong vitality, echoing the alchemists’ dream.

## Philosophical Interpretations

In Laegna, the Philosopher’s Stone is defined by the dual measurements of life:

- **Quality:** The positive or negative growth factor, symbolizing spiritual and moral development.
- **Quantity:** The length of life, representing physical longevity.

Hermetics and Christians had vivid interpretations of Good and Bad, contrasting with the more nuanced views of Buddhists or Taoists. Their ultimate goal was to eradicate all mortality and sickness, akin to defeating Satan, and achieve a state of eternal goodness.

## Contemporary Relevance in Laegna

Laegna embraces the conceptions of sin and cos, integrating **fears and hopes** to augment Buddhist and Logec values. The pursuit of truth is seen as a gradual progress where each negative experience is neutralized in the imaginary infinity. The ultimate goal is to transmute matter and achieve immortality by enhancing the integrity and length of life.

### Philosophical Doubt and Certainty

In Laegna, philosophers are encouraged to doubt deeply held beliefs, seeking certainty through reason and rationality. This approach avoids excessive liberalism, stoicism, or addiction:

- **Excess liberalism:** Abandoning strict life values.
- **Stoicism:** Surviving without meaning.
- **Addiction:** Overcoming rationality but succumbing to physical pleasures and pains.

### Symbolic Meaning

The Philosopher’s Stone symbolizes the balance between open-mindedness and steadfastness. While philosophers doubt and question, they maintain a core truth, strengthening it through the process.

## Follow-Up Ideas

1. **Comparative Study:** Explore how different cultures and philosophies interpret the concept of ultimate transformation and immortality.
2. **Scientific Advances:** Investigate modern biomedical research and its parallels with alchemical pursuits.
3. **Philosophical Dialogue:** Engage in discussions on the balance between doubt and certainty in philosophical thought.
4. **Cultural Integration:** Examine how Laegna’s integration of sin, cos, and Logec values enriches traditional Buddhist and Taoist principles.
