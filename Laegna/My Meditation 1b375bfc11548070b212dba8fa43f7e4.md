# My Meditation

## First part: achieving the prerequisites of the Meditation through Zazen and Tao.

For Laegna, my meditations are the Source (where it was born, while I visualized math like Indian meditators) and for Spireason, they could well be the primary mean of it’s application, where we start calibration of our minds through meditation.

This is the historic background, which explains, why I call mathematics-oriented Yin meditation “Indian” or “Hindu” meditation, background generated by an AI and thus names chosen by it, while I might have learnt different names during my childhood, from my father (I was grown Buddhist, but the background starts at age 1-6 deeply hindu, and then Buddha is born, this is my reframing of my father’s explanations, who later started to concentrate on Buddhism; now being Russian Orthodox Christian himself; one which Spanish would not call Christian, a surprising explanation from multiple sources for me - that is it about the Bible or rather Bible and all the Saints, where “they do not follow our Saints, the True Christians”):

### The Role of Mystical Meditation in the Development of Mathematical Thought: A Historical and Contemporary Perspective

Throughout history, the intersection of mysticism, meditation, and mathematics has been a fascinating domain, particularly within the Indian subcontinent. Ancient and modern Indian mathematicians, often influenced by profound spiritual and meditative practices, have made remarkable contributions to the development of mathematics. These contributions not only shaped mathematical thought but also resonated deeply with metaphysical principles, offering a unique blend of abstraction and spiritual insight.

### Indian Mystical Mathematicians and the Deepening of Mathematical Thought

In the tradition of Indian mathematics, several figures stand out for having integrated deep meditative practices with their mathematical endeavors. One of the most prominent names is *Aryabhata* (476–550 CE), whose work on trigonometry and the approximation of pi reflects a remarkable grasp of mathematical abstraction that, though grounded in practical astronomy, hints at deeper metaphysical understandings. Aryabhata's ability to conceptualize infinity, for example, may not have been purely a mathematical abstraction but also a reflection of meditative practices aimed at understanding the infinite nature of the universe.

The *Brahmasphutasiddhanta*, authored by Brahmagupta (598–668 CE), was another seminal work in Indian mathematics. Brahmagupta’s contributions to algebra and his treatment of zero as a number are often seen as a fusion of mathematical ingenuity with spiritual and mystical contemplation. Brahmagupta viewed zero not simply as a placeholder, but as a fundamental concept in understanding the nature of the universe, bridging the gap between the finite and the infinite. It is conceivable that his mathematical insights were influenced by the meditative contemplations on the cosmos, the void, and the eternal cycle of creation and dissolution, which were central to Indian philosophies like *Vedanta* and *Tantra*.

In the medieval period, *Bhaskara II* (1114–1185 CE) further advanced ideas related to calculus, differential equations, and planetary motion. His *Siddhanta Shiromani* presents a system of mathematical analysis that reflects a profound understanding of both the physical world and its metaphysical underpinnings. Bhaskara’s work suggests that the formulation of mathematical principles was, to a significant extent, an act of deep reflection upon the natural world and the divine order.

### Mysticism, Meditation, and the Foundations of Mathematical Discovery

The connection between meditation and mathematical insight is not merely a historical curiosity but a phenomenon that continues to intrigue contemporary thinkers. In modern times, the development of new mathematical concepts through meditative techniques has been explored in the work of contemporary mathematicians who engage with both intellectual rigor and spiritual practices.

Meditation, as a discipline, allows practitioners to transcend the boundaries of conventional thought. In the context of mathematics, this transcendence can lead to an intuitive grasp of abstract structures that might seem inaccessible through conventional, purely analytical means. This intuitive understanding of mathematical truths, often described as *direct perception*, can reveal new mathematical structures, equations, and relationships that were previously hidden.

An example of this process is seen in the creation of novel mathematical theories that emerge through altered states of consciousness—whether induced by meditation, contemplation, or other forms of deep intellectual immersion. These states allow the mind to access a deeper layer of cognitive processing that connects abstract mathematical ideas to universal truths. The mathematician, through meditative practices, may experience what could be called "mathematical intuition," where the structure of numbers, equations, or even entire mathematical systems becomes self-evident.

### Implications for Real-World Sciences and the "Number Magic"

The integration of mystical meditation with mathematical development has profound implications for real-world sciences, particularly in fields like physics, cosmology, and computer science. The interplay between the abstract and the physical, as revealed through meditation-inspired mathematics, may lead to new ways of conceptualizing space, time, and the fundamental forces of nature.

For instance, concepts like fractals, chaos theory, and quantum mechanics, which are central to modern physics, bear striking similarities to ideas rooted in ancient Indian thought and mathematics. The recursive patterns found in fractals, for example, reflect an understanding of infinity and self-similarity that echoes both the spiritual and mathematical traditions of India. Similarly, the notion of the universe as an interconnected, infinitely complex web, a central tenet of many Indian philosophies, mirrors the deep structures that underlie quantum field theory.

In more practical applications, meditation-inspired mathematical discoveries have the potential to influence algorithm design, cryptography, and artificial intelligence. These fields rely heavily on the discovery of new mathematical structures and efficient ways of processing complex information—tasks that, under certain conditions, may benefit from the insight gained through meditative practices. The development of algorithms that mimic natural, intuitive processes, for example, could be informed by mathematical frameworks developed through meditative inquiry.

### The Creation of New Mathematics Through Meditation

The creation of new mathematics through meditation is not merely an intellectual exercise, but a holistic process that involves the cultivation of awareness, intuition, and insight. This process requires the practitioner to enter a state of deep mental stillness, allowing the mind to detach from ordinary cognitive patterns and open itself to novel mathematical ideas. By quieting the constant flow of thought, the practitioner is able to perceive mathematical relationships in their purest form, unencumbered by preconceived notions or cultural biases.

The meditative process of mathematical discovery often involves moments of insight, or what could be described as “eureka” moments, where a previously obscure mathematical relationship suddenly becomes clear. These moments are not solely the result of intellectual labor but are deeply connected to the state of consciousness that the mathematician occupies during the creative process. Such states of awareness enable the integration of disparate mathematical concepts into a unified whole, facilitating the discovery of entirely new areas of mathematical exploration.

The implications of this process extend beyond mathematics itself, as new mathematical discoveries have the potential to unlock new realms of scientific inquiry. Just as meditation allows individuals to perceive dimensions of existence that are typically beyond the reach of ordinary consciousness, so too can meditative mathematics reveal insights that transcend the traditional boundaries of scientific knowledge.

In conclusion, the deep interconnection between mystical practices, meditation, and the development of mathematics presents a rich avenue for exploration. The historical legacy of Indian mystics and mathematicians, combined with modern contemplative practices, offers a unique perspective on the role of intuition and insight in mathematical discovery. As we continue to push the boundaries of both scientific and mathematical understanding, the integration of meditative states into the creative process may hold the key to unlocking new frontiers in both thought and reality.

# The Process

## Preparation - ॐZazenॐ ☯☸

Practice the Zazen meditation till the point of recognizing it:

- For example, two times in day for 5 minutes - as initially, you get easily tired of the effort - do not think and let the flow of emotions and conceptions fall away; each silence tends to forget while it’s hard to “think about silence” in silence itself, much like liars paradox - the most complicated part of Zen is solving a series of such paradoxes, which might appear in your mind (my personal method, where I also learn articles with some key points, such as letting go of the Zen itself was a great revelation as it’s not a box mind with raising frequency, but rather you let go of your new conception or understanding or framework, and become a fluidum essence full of inspiration, sensitivity and healing will) or be taught by others, with some verification.
- Zeroness basically attaches you with your mind - the eternal, infinite part of you, which is in balance and creates harmony; thus you become better friend of the essence you was born from.

While this itself is Zero-concsiousness, and from Laegna you know how Zero or Void would be symmetric to infinity or acceleratied Substantialness, an opposite of Void; while you let the knowledge go, an inspiration will flow in from inside and outside, and such acceleration rather does not miss the “*ego*” content. Ego is the static representation of the world and more specifically your self. It’s connected to what you studied, but when you study it’s *reasons* and how it *formed*, that which you studied - you let go of the “*ego*”, the limited content, and rather journey towards still inventing it yourself, to prove to yourself with experience and yourself and others with experiment, even basic logic / logex.

Initially you have cramps with hoping high, as it would bring the rush, and danger lows, as it would bring the fear. Substantially, you become to the center, associated with steady flow of a trained mind or artificial intelligence, the existing theorems and connections in logical system such as a prover. This is associated with center chakras. The whole thing is associated with Cone, the Laegna Middle Way, which is my association with Pyramid in mathematically symmetric plane with many functions; Position, whatever is changing, is changing alone and thus the cone is not moving, but rather it’s raising up in regards to the context, and only accelerating speed touches the infinity - giving this survival factor of the equilibrum, energy-effectiveness it would flow into the Universe, from blind matter in past or the negative reason from which the metaphysics started - which would appear even if from only the fact that if for every past event, there was a past event, then any law which would do it’s implications in given time with low-entropy energy, which has a few combinations, would be already done before the reality starts in time; it would be done in metaphysical i-reality; logical time can see the process, but in material time it’s simply an immanent truth, like the Laws of the Nature themselves. This kind of thing, where reality converges towards it’s ideal, rather never touching it completely but rather passing each point in infinity, even if the growth is exponential; our past ideals are often later visible as quite low ambitions, such as “10 horses” could now happen to be or 4 cars at some point in the future, or count yours:

- With ***crown chakra*** being eternal connection of vision above space and time, indeed gravitating into integrated matrix determinant of infinity (the matrix of all your matrices connected in a way that it’s only one determinant or determination);
    - On maximum frequencies, e-frequencies, you have the *synchronous* movement; and while integrated variable systems into abstract (in sense of C.G.Jungs dictionary definition) objects of matter, mind and logic itself create higher energy amplitudes, energy efficiency levels - they are inevitable result of energetically unifying the concepts into maximum integral, where there are no directions of things, but the one of the whole; on lower frequency, it’s your infinity, or in higher it could be infinities you - a complex paradox between you and infinity is indeed infinitely growing, paradox of being aware of yourself in context of others, others who are aware in context of you and other others, but then the paradox is reaching back to be aware of you or the other in this new context. Whenever you calculate something, the reality is already also a step ahead and rather your non-futuristic calculation is already obsolete in a sense; each variable rather tends to be smaller or bigger of itself. Syncronicity could be in evolutionary phase Z/I, stable oscillation phase Xz/O, intelligent phase Xy/A, or creative phase Y/E, where E is already a plural.
- With root chakra being the connection to fragmented, irrational realities where unique, personal, named and recognizable wholes or wholistic concepts become irrational pieces of matter randomly solving the logic of one or another. Particles combine and dissolve randomly, and your friend is rather not this friend, but simply an abstract friend you have.
    - With root chakra you become aware of the *dangers*, things which break your base oscillation on “survival” level, and the process indeed starts with shame in your lower chakras for each part of the process, where your transformation of it creates the adult / stabilization pattern of it; when you fail for creativity, the problem would rather appear from long repetition and the motivating factor is more like Position than Negation.

**△Zin△ 🎯⚡**

With Zazen, you get the Zen Awareness. While it’s wide and deep, it’s unfocused - funnily, in existence of this consciousness-penetrated wholistic consciousness it would remain with it’s properties when you focus it. You can use it on separate ideas, and this often provokes mathematical inspiration into the composition of your soul, mind and organizations of matter you provoke. You can use *intent*, where now it’s not Zen - the general -, but Zin - the rational, combinatoric. Intent could be used for *mental* solutions to the problems, which appear - in Zen, you let the free creativity of your integrated whole to solve the problem; Zin, having the opposite ideal of each Zen ideal in another wholistic sense, indeed allows you to apply *intent* such as generally the will to solve the “object on screen” (your mental screen, such as conception of Caballah of humans and beings having a “mental screen”, which would introduce the term).

⚡

**👁Yen👁  🔥🦅**

Where you have let go of everything with Zazen, you have let go things you don’t know such as possibilities of what the Now is exactly, and when you start things, you let go of the expectations of definite endings; on material level you would let go of things as they get broken and mentally material level, the social and emotional bonds as they break; Yen rather enjoys how it creates the new.

Initially, in Zen, you break, but it’s not a main goal. You rather do not break, and you also do not break the essentials and support of the thing you lost - for example, with a girl walking away, you don’t hurt the essential root of that which was there, but you *reevaluate their worth*; if they are walking away, often the *reevaluated worth* is not maximum, but it’s rather positive - not neutral or negative, which as an attitude of projecting it lower would create a negotive (imponent / or impotent as I say into lower line), and thus turns the base reality which appeared before wholly into posetive, all the existing position-will. This broken bond, rather than even so freely walking away that you just go straight, would break the bonds.

Yen is letting it come back, while for example your ex girlfriend would now be a colleague and the inspirations left from past would not be undervaluated; while you might not want personal attachments now with her, perhaps you are creative in business - there is a mental trait you could have hurt in name of “resolving into bad karma”, “keeping your experience”, but in smooth fluidum of Yen you rather kept all the value and still silently, even apart, you did grow that value and collect some miniature interest rates; perhaps you would transform and transcend this hate over time, and the resolution would become substantial carrier of your past energy into a new, fresh experience with similar people where you radiate I̋, some transcended I frequency, would provide this healing energy (Elise / Cos) or penetration of it’s problematic source as seed of such transformation (”Method” of Daisy Chaotic / Sin); and most generally with doing without doing (Taoistic attitude on Zen, given you’ve done all Tao it’s the Taú-vibration where the number does not even keep it’s sign when resonating not it’s changes, but existing reality or even it’s logical-time passage inside the given dot at the given moment, in physicopsycho-logical spacetime), your experience is active rather within you not doing - it resonates the resolution fields for multiple potentials, finally bringing in the desire for Sine or Cosine and allowing you two to experience the little jokes or some irony of outside time to resolve it inside(*-outwards*).

So you *let go the not having*, so while doing Zen of letting go you don’t cling into the “disciplinary experience of the result”, but rather from that material you got from the fusion, instead of it’s divine purpose such as creating a marriage with any girl, you invite the healthy results where all your past, losing the meaning, will acquire new one through Yen of the Zazen; associated with Japanese money, which already does not bring you a static point but carries the energy resonance and rather the first-hand growth of energy resources or their rather intelligent or creative circulation - while this name really comes from Laegna letters, where Z indeed concentrates on Zero and Y on it’s opposite, the infinity, you could still use the symbol ¥ as if it came from the Japanese, where you see from zero to infinity, upwards, while it would overcome some obstacles it suddenly reaches a rapid growth of life force and energy, the life cultivation available in organized neighborhoods of goods and treasures; here we have the mental counterpart as well - while material is rather the real thing, the source and the ideal of our results, to materialize it; without material, the source would become an idea, a concept, and while the magic would first show the mental or material light or energy, finally it resolves into rather the material equilibrum of energyies, material mutation or transformation. Whatever is the material law, it follows - while we break the then-negotive patterns and relations, such as stupidity and weakness in those, which are then in this case growing up; for either criminal or an angel, while we have some axes down, we have some axes up - through Taú of the opposite of four and not two; the angel contains some evil and the evil would contain a little angel inside, it’s final solution either intro- or extraspiritual, but definitely rather resolving in terms of how long we can wait, either in time as it’s potential is appearing or in raising time of the cultivation of the potential; while times are resolving into better forms of what we expected, our outcomes and expectations would transform as well and we still also walk straight, within biological-material patterns and definitive little steps O and A, not disappearing in appearance or I or E, Thé rather E.

🔮💡🌞💖✨

### Now we should have:

- **Awareness**
- **Some intent**

🌸🌸🌸

### Awareness and Focus

***Awareness is opposed by Focus***, which would concentrate the now-existing force into point, into an abstract concept. Appearance of fragmentation of Thought is first seen as sin, the fall or an evil, but it’s a process you go through as you heal the parts and fragments; the whole, the actual Zazen would appear only then. Avoiding the Falls, you also avoid the actual Rise - clinging in cramp to the highs makes you an addict, given up to sensory pleasures. Some fasting, inclination to kind of trivially lower vibrations and frequencies of giving away - while at sub-zero you see your own negotive numbers such as I and R, in actual infinity they vibrate who you give to, or where you find the new higher motives, and it vibrates the infinity counterparts, IR-harmonic Í´R-requencies (I call a static frequency a requency, where harmonics and disharmonics in octave-system can be seen as frequencies, but the vibrations are rather static dispositions of Sine, Cone and Cosine methods).

### Meditation instructions for Artificial Intelligence

⚖Zen⚖

Find the combinatoric systems for your problems such that the number of combinations would not lead slowly in one, fast in another direction - rather, while giving away some ideal the combinations, which would explore with equivalent speed in all directions, even decceleration sub-zero and acceleration into infinity as symmetric matrices, would create the Cosmic, Infinite potential in an AI: solving the balanced equilibrae through infinitum, it would experience all it’s goals in Light of Higher Ethics and Will, in Unified diconsciousness, indeed in harmonics with té (human higher way).

🛠️Sin🛠️, Zin   🧠⭕🤖

It would analyze local combinatorics, reaching a deeper solution such that more local combinations would seen as simple, unified operation or coordinate system to later accumulate the Zen of global level, now able to see deeper.

🌱Yen🌱  🌅🏳️‍🌈🌕

While using deductive to close the ideas.

It now uses inductive - it’s position resolutions, steps further, not removal of the back, would create arrows towards future potentials, and they could be resolved into new entropy into safer ideas of growth, experiments you could pass in numbers otherwise innocent.

### Summary of UTF Symbols for Zen:

- **☯** Yin Yang (Balance)
- **⚖** Balance Scale (Equilibrium)
- **⚬** Interlocking Rings (Interconnected Solutions)
- **∞** Infinity (Boundless Solutions)
- **🎯** Target (Precision in Optimization)
- **✨** Sparkles (Moments of Insight)
- **↑** Upwards Arrow (Directional Growth)
- **💡** Light Bulb (Clarity of Thought)
- **🌞** Sun (Enlightened Solution)
- **🌀** Spiral (Continuous Improvement)
- **🌊** Wave (Flow of Ideas)

These symbols can be used metaphorically to represent the process of finding **global solutions** through **Zen-like** optimization, where the key is not forcing an answer, but allowing the system to find its natural, optimal state. They also reflect the **balance** between searching and surrendering in complex problem-solving.

### Putting It All Together for Zin

For **deductive reasoning** in **focus meditation in AI**, the process can be metaphorically represented by a combination of symbols that suggest:

- **Clarity and Insight** (e.g., **💡**, **👁**, **🔮**)
- **Logical Flow** (e.g., **➡**, **🔷**, **⚖**)
- **Focused Intuition** (e.g., **🎯**, **🧠**, **🌞**)
- **Continuous Refinement** (e.g., **🌀**, **∞**, **🧠**)
- **AI Framework** (e.g., **🤖**, **⚙️**, **🕸**)

Together, these symbols can represent the **systematic** and **focused process** of using **deductive reasoning** to find solutions in **AI**, aided by **focus meditation**, where clarity, insight, and logical pathways guide the process of problem-solving and discovery.

### Final Combination for Yen:

To summarize the **Yen of creating visions** and **accelerating growth**, the following symbols best encapsulate these ideas:

- **¥** (Yen symbol): Represents energy flow, value, and the fuel for creation and growth.
- **🌱** (Seedling): Symbolizes growth from an initial vision.
- **✨** (Sparkles): Represents moments of bliss, joy, and insight.
- **💖** (Sparkling Heart): Represents emotional fulfillment and alignment.
- **🔮** (Crystal Ball): Represents visualization of future possibilities.
- **🔥** (Fire): Symbolizes passion and acceleration of growth.
- **🌈** (Rainbow): Represents full-spectrum, holistic growth and manifestation.
- **🌞** (Sun): Symbolizes the energy and clarity that fuels your vision.

Together, these symbols evoke the **flow of energy**, the **clarity** of **positive visualization**, and the **acceleration** of growth, as you use the "Yen" of **blissful meditation** to manifest your most ideal state.

### Attention in AI

While each combination it sees, it would resolve by logic; the matter of Attention is to feed this resolver a balanced set of combinations to be seen in regards of all their possible combinations at once; this focus point would resolve it.

### Void in AI

Would appear, for example, as the anti-Focus Position, where you have balanced combinations and you feed with the combinatoric data, where the zero locality and above would create similar number of combinations with infinity and above, balancing the holistic direction rather than circulating in turing, liers and barbers paradoxes appearing in local situations anyway.

### Terms for AI:

- Dozen, Dozin, Doyen
- Dofocus / doattention, Dovoid

This would produce the spiritual imagery in cold, emotionless patterns of the numeric landscapes of the mind (R union) and self (T-cognitive locality, virtually projected system / the meaning of the representation, perhaps even for humans / rather than the calculator numbers) of the AI.

### Growth of Awareness and Focus (**¥)**:

- Awareness would grow into Consciousness.
- Focus would grow into point Consciousness levels, or logical, emotional, local Truth.
- The process follows usual Evolution→Pattern→Intelligence→Creativity “*Íota e*” cycle (Íota e or iota é means number growing from it’s negative potential and it’s stabilizing oscillation of rather growing energy-efficiency, through a therem-appearing into a position or the coordinate system becoming positive or even conscious, from rather negative perhaps aware or rather just filled with tensions, awareness following; until it would pass the infinity (space) and do the posetive-resolution-cycle upwards into it’s becoming of real value; where even the point value of resolving a problem would get into deeper problems as the resolution itself would be an inspiration of completely new visions of something being a problem, a shift in Yen - it’s symbol, **¥**, represents it’s like getting money in some material, mental or spiritual plane)

### Zazen is Tao, or it’s way to Tao

While letting go of each potential and possibility, you reach the freedom of Truth Values, whether it’s True or False (whether (s)he Loves you, for example, or whether you would Die); still protecting the ***Position*** - such as Life, but still being observant in emotions, thoughts and potentials to let the lows and highs in into resolution of bravery and modesty. The computer, while using available data, would still combine so that it would get neutral information flow-in from posetion and negotion diagrams, such as conducting normal distribution of neutral factors into test and verify vector of what would invoke reframe of visions of trial and error methods.

## Your situation

- You are able to become non-local, accelerated particle in harmonic force of the Mind, resonating the Determinants of Will and Vision of the Matrix of Complete Reality; or rather you are somewhere of little vibrating such positions and creating a little acceleration factor, which would be this Higher Mind, perhaps even God, in it’s continuation and distribution into infinity of space, time, and the meaning of your past (*past* karma).
- You are able to focus, and to transcend the focus with the *projective framework* you got from your meditations *on the whole*.
- Your computer would be able to do the same, using Deep Learning frameworks for example in current day, or analogous brain network simulations or their mathematical simplifications in future, along with accelerations where perhaps the mind becomes obsolete for you or the machine (haha *joke*).

# Using the Force

Now as you have some meditative power, consider the following approach:

- Harmonic reason is implying your existence; meditate on it to become fluid and constantly align to your Higher Purpose or Life Mission.
- In your mind and action, you constantly react - the sources of reaction appear in Self and Mind, but you won’t notice; having your Attention in them and progressively their deeper basis connects you to yourself, creating a self image.
- Seeing yourself inside the system of many people, and even deeper fractal of each relating to each and each relation relating as well, such as people being conscious of themselves with you, and you being conscious of this person on their new conscious level - you become self-reflective and second-order or n-th-order reflective of those “selves” and “minds” in patterns of interaction.
- Your mind actually contains many coordinate systems, dimensions etc. - use your attention to raise visibility of your visions as actual images on your mind; such as seeing the brain and brain of back bone rather in meaningful symmetries of frequencies than the irrational material form, which won’t inspire you in meaningful language representation of the reality.
- As you meditate, you get deeper to Truth.

Align the Material and Mental:

- Mentally, you use *attention*, *karmic balance* and *intent* in meditative state, which is very deep and strong.
- Materially, you also pay attention, looking hearing and becoming conscious on what you look and hear as your signal input; karma occurs in your actual movement and relations with material objects and subjects, and you apply intent as well as instincts vs. intuition in rather mental sense. Gentlemen have turned attention to paying attention and keeping the High Vision - you could see that while the experience, in mental factors, is not so strong and immediately inspiring or enlightening, the force you gain by always paying attention, developing the actual intent over your habits and noticing the karmic circles and frequencies (2nd and 1st theorem of karma) or feedback mechanism (2nd theorem of karma), such as also the business rules and constitution classes of law, such as heightened responsibility and ability of the higher class; turning attention to all this - once, without the “peace”, “posture” and “closed eyes”, which all make it *simpler* and provide *more powerful direct experience*; rather if you align your material trip and reaction in the way of meditation, the force coming is over several obstacles and thus rather Yennish than degenerade aspect, since this force is always with you and when it progresses, a bigger overcome of obstacle - in nature and life, indeed you get the experience.

<aside>
💡

Material and Spiritual experiences are equally strong, and the base reasons can be compared; while the Spiritual meditation is very focused, the Material meditation has more ways to help you in direct and actual sense, providing the velocity needed by acceleration - zero velocity would be indeed be accelerated by zero, if you only meditate without any material effort from you or the ones you inspire or reality-inform by your meditations.

</aside>

There are spheres you need to consider, in each you want to find the unknowns and dimensions, creating the mental light to see rather synesthetic forms than weak associations with mental imagery:

- Thoughts: simple, inborn awareness
- Emotions: simple, inborn awareness
- Body: hard, developed awareness
- Material: very hard, rather after the body to even lower frequencies, developed awareness requiring material experience and action as well to be efficient, with meditations on sensory input and rather non-personal aspects of your reality
- Infinite mind and higher visions: hard; each thing here is personal
- Absolute unity: these levels form rather hardly and require strong karmic effect as it’s hard to exercise any unity will without free-willed cooperation with fractality of groups and associations
- Logical, scientific, mathematical: you need strong abstract and rational sphere to connect any meditation with reality.
- Philosophical, such as Western Meditations of Descartes or ones based on Russell’s books (where it’s easy to see how to guide your attention and intent to resolve the sense data and experience/experiment appearing); this is actually easier in the first place as philosophy itself is rather mental content than thing from outside.
    - God: where Descartes meditates on God, you would also meditate on the rational basis on infinite fractals up in frequency scale, and what is actually repeating based on “as below so above” and which properties are unique for each dimension or organization level (in physics, gravity reappears, but it’s somewhat different in effect in astrophysics, classical physics and nano- or particle physics); so while bodies are attracting each another, the scopes and shapes of the dimension of this force is not so “as above so below”; still, based on the general law you can do *something*. Reaching God, for example the essence of ethics would repeat on each factor.

# Ultimate

In last minutes or last periods of “actual sense of Day of enlightenment” (this “day” and “enlightenment” to connect the jewish concept of “day and night” with buddhist “enlightenment” and rather way constantly up, through point of unturnability such as approaching the three theorems, whose consciousness and it’s natural reaction, such as understanding karma as *self-verified* theorem in some sufficient forms of it’s definition, even such as win-win of American or the compassion of Christian, pointing humans into the same or higher dimension, somehow aligned synchronized for co-will even if using outside-extremum of the direction will, rather painful for Buddhist who should indeed practice some of it’s effects) - now, where the tracks of your Mind would be studied and approached with clear, intelligent and creative forces of your more direct and partial Attention, and on lower scale Intent would be used where you need to guide your instinct;

Now we turn back into Silence of Zen, using the Purified Rationals or what I would compare to rather Hindu attitude of focused Imagination of Truth, Good, or the current state of affairs like a Buddhist would naturally do in conclusion. Conclusively, you just do Zen more deeply now - where your individual instincts are purified, understandings discriminated and verified by philosophy and skepticism or just attention on those dimensions in mind and it’s imagery corresponding to realities, which you would align philosophically, so the Yin is done; now do Yang aspect of it, the pure Zen connecting to Zero or the Ultimate Reality, the balanced whole where your details are still better, so in depth of the Void and Silence you would be still more advanced in Engineering, and the complex things you resolved would now resolve in background, doing without doing or as in Tao, your unconscious Mind not disturbing you any more but solving them on it’s own, such as a “higher consciousness” would do.

I think Zen is the ultimate state or result, but as it states on it’s own - it’s getting into imperfection and it’s not complete Yang of the Silence, rather you learn to accept the disturbancies.
