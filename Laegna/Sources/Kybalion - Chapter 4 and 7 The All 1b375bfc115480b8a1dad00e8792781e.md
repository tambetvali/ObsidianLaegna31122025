# Kybalion - Chapter 4 and 7 The All

Kybalion is a great book, containing a nice axiomatic set of principles, which rather hold, and the introduction of chapters 4-7 (here given the first and last of these), which introduce to the God.

How to see this:

- While I think principles and the self story of Kybalion is perfect, the version of Three Initiates contains at least 2 scientific “mistakes” in my sense, and we are not very interested in latest developments of physics and psychology of their date, where rather a little note of “gold rush” of autor would shine through, where the original description of “the ALL” along with all 7 principles do not contain such, but are rather neutral; author’s answer to principle of imperfection / incompleteness is instead weak, being a “hack”, where we have method of sinus and cosinus and indeed approach it with greater acceptance and less “christian faith” believing in cramp of avoiding the negotive - in *definition*, it’s *unavoidable*, but the solution definitely *does avoid* it, leading to kind of paradox that bad would happen instead to you later and more strongly, or more strongly outside the jewish circle of polarity I mention when defining the Law of Imperfection in Laegna tautology / root article here.
- It states about the Mind; indeed if the final infinity of physical, spiritual and logical matters is going to influence the Reality, it’s rather so: while we are like material for it, people rather forming a lower level of matter simply in this mathematical frequency where they are not accelerating, but gaining the velocity in group work. Indeed, this reality has much closer, simpler and more coherent picture we call “Mind”, namely it’s R value - and we know for each entity the R is rather consciousness on it’s own level -, as explained in Alchemists Stone Eternal Life Theorems; we can see that this zoomout like YYY (Y^Y level of the zoomout to form some idea of God), there he would see the people as material and symbolic, logical system of his world, and rather the Mind would appear for any order, simplicity and elegance of his, rather showing the very big generalization or linearization of fractal systems as His mental content and imagery.
- Possibly, vibrating that once somewhere high, some lower octaves of humans would resonate, providing us with logic, body or spirit of Mind of the topmost vibration; in this cycle the possibility of reincarnations as humans is not mathematical zero as easily, the system would naturally provide such effect and replicate the God’s vibration’s harmonic tone on the layer of human existence, much lower vibration.
- For God, human Gods or gods who have reached hologram levels of infinity vibrations are win-win, good deities and useful; it’s rather what He is seeking based on analysis.
- In materialist position, we see the “Mind” rather as R value, and the values of some creative or intelligent impulses of God rather as some inevitable convergence of the evolutionary value, where systems react with their infinite limit values even in evolution, and rather the physical and energy wave holograms appear, where this limit is repeated enough that we could see a frequency of God appearing trivially in human activities, as a mathematical and symbolic projection of Truth and Wisdom, and other infinite qualities - those two are there only if they properly align with infinitely extended theorems where karma has infinite consequences and effectors.

While we find many accounts of God, this one is *metaphysical*, meaning that it aligns with quite simple logic; where we philosophize and don’t take it word-by-word, we rather can find, aligned with Spireason, that each sentence is linked to something rather true scientifically, in alterations where for example the “Mind” can be slow and rather evolutionary or non-conscious flow of the paradoxes and solutions in relation to infinity, which approaches the limits like Earth, locally, approaches the local flatness.

We do the philosophical method of God:

- While God as a creature is complex, we do analyze the infinities and the energy circles assuming that the world around us is also containing progressive gradient than higher vibrations of us; not very unreachable, the limits come as close as “locally flat Earth”, where we assume that our ideas start aligning with at least the lower levels of “Mind of God”, as this limit value is close to actual R, which is in our strict math simply equal to Mind of a living subject of dead matter, which definitely has some R values, interaction with context and the reasons giving birth of it as rather Position or Negation than the polarity of them; rather vuLife than vuDeath (upside down and direct u’s used as unknown consonant and unknown vocal, such as dí-, do-, ta-, té- -life/-death).
- As Bertrand Russell philosophy method: where we create the framework based on rather science, such as experience, experiment and coherent logical systems, once we have it and in advance, we need to use our rather irrational senses and acts of will; those senses contain rather *irrational information*, where even spiritual and deity senses would evolve over context of Right Reflection, leading us to consider the right symbols and our mind to present with realistic “dream of the life” on realistic screen of what we would call fantasy, imagination or dream state reality in case *our interpretation is aligned to it’s essence*, where while the ideas might resemble other ideas, it’s more proper to apply the discrimination and meditation of separating them and aligning our Projective System of Reason rather properly to rather irrational physical and spiritual senses, where the physical is the Real and spiritual is the Source, which could be the creation of the Real - indeed, we base our shifts to the Reality dimensions, but we apply that the mental work, such as intelligence, creativity and spirituality or even more complex scientific visions and analysis of higher order systems are a heavy catalyst, called “acceleration” in Laegna vs. material “velocity”, where we go to higher order integral to create the presence of Laegna Termodynamic System and see that we can assume normal principles of thermodynamic systems.

Even in Kybalion, you could see a thermodynamic system of energy:

1. **Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics**: concept of temperature as energy measure; symmetry relations of heat systems; it creates something like universality of ethics, where unions, when overlapping, create bigger unions, which is common also in spiritual systems once completely analyzed as accumulative systems of thermodynamics.
2. **First Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Energy Conservation)**: energy, such as intelligence and creativity, does not appear randomly but rather accumulates and distributes in dynamic system; with proper acceleration factor of Laegna rather odd (with special multiplier) number, we would see the energy conservation law applied to how we accumulate the knowledge and use it for accumulation of knowledge and the practice, then providing practical basis for accumulation of knowledge. It also applies, in even higher frequency, with accumulation of creativity thus showing that physical system of thermodynamics makes sense “as above so below”, accross different frequency levels, reaching to even God on the potential field - for God, energy flows through potentials with their illumination and disgrace or lack of acceleration, where God would live in the “real world” with laws of imperfection, such as the long time to develop the material world and it’s metaphysical aspect of “now”.
3. **Second Law of Thermodynamics**: we are mainly interested in creative input of evolution, still agreeing that it also would introduce some chaos. Evolution, where some factors of genes are random, also is quite good in copying other factors and involving the sensibility of Love, higher Love, and the case that whatever humans do, they are, which makes the evolution especially intelligent in sense that it can be reframed by the being inside, by their free will to be this or that species in their actual outcomes and behaviour (for example, humans could be meat-eaters or not, culturally shaping that what we attribute to evolution in lower animals, showing that in relation, our evolution is intelligent). Any species would heavily rely on statistical, gaussian distribution and symmetries of randomness, but still also carry the solid genes less apt to change, and the custom developments possible based on those genes; we are consciously approaching the fundamental and the random aspects of our development systems, and how we benefit from both - indeed, the bigger mutation factor could also occur in random mutations, but each system also needs both variables and random selections; so the complete system would not be as random as it seems, even if randomness rather seems to relate to the creative entropy factor.
4. **Third Law of Thermodynamics**: it simply states that without energy, we cannot create, and thus the energy parameters of existing system, in different projections is still zero or above, not below; for example while intelligence factors 4, 2 and -5 can coexist as a system in balanced measure, -4, -2 and 5 would lack 1 unit of energy, thus they do not make sense in terms of envisioning human creativity and intelligence in terms of their termodynamic properties, and is not possible in spiritual. Still, the efficiency gain we get from organizing the matter of reality is infinite as we optimize in higher and higher infinities; mathematically you buy and sell - while some of your basic math can be impossible in given condition, in infinite chain of relations you can “buy” that theorem or cancel the negative effect out elsewhere, so you would do something business-like with the mathematical conditions and their actual replaceability even in fundamental level; for example, by raising the temperature otherwere, the temperature of your system might, involving loan calculation (the mathematical payback of it’s negative aspects of influence), get to lower degree of actual kinetic or potential energy than before, thus you are buying some “mathematical freedom” instead of following a static theorem.

CHAPTER 4. THE ALL
"Under, and back of, the Universe of Time, Space and Change, is ever to be
found The Substantial Reality--the Fundamental Truth."--The Kybalion.
"Substance" means: "that which underlies all outward manifestations; the
essence; the essential reality; the thing in itself," etc. "Substantial" means:
"actually existing; being the essential element; being real," etc. "Reality"
means: "the state of being real; true, enduring; valid; fixed; permanent;
actual," etc.
Under and behind all outward appearances or manifestations, there must
always be a Substantial Reality. This is the Law. Man considering the
Universe, of which he is a unit, sees nothing but change in matter, forces,
and mental states. He sees that nothing really IS, but that everything is
BECOMING and CHANGING. Nothing stands still-everything is being born,
growing, dying-the very instant a thing reaches its height, it begins to
decline--the law of rhythm is in constant operation--there is no reality,
enduring quality, fixity, or substantiality in anything-- nothing is permanent
but Change. He sees all things evolving from other things, and resolving into
other things--constant action and reaction; inflow and outflow; building up
and tearing down; creation and destruction; birth, growth and death.
Nothing endures but Change. And if he be a thinking man, he realizes that all
of these changing things must be but outward appearances or
manifestations of some Underlying Power--some Substantial Reality.
All thinkers, in all lands and in all times, have assumed the necessity for
postulating the existence of this Substantial Reality. All philosophies worthy
of the name have been based upon this thought. Men have given to this
Substantial Reality many names-some have called it by the term of Deity
(under many titles). Others have called it "The Infinite and Eternal Energy"
others have tried to call it "Matter"--but all have acknowledged its
existence. It is self-evident it needs no argument.
In these lessons we have followed the example of some of the world's
greatest thinkers, both ancient and modern--the Hermetic. Masters--and
21
have called this Underlying Power--this Substantial Reality--by the Hermetic
name of "THE ALL," which term we consider the most comprehensive of the
many terms applied by Man to THAT which transcends names and terms.
We accept and teach the view of the great Hermetic thinkers of all times, as
well as of those illumined souls who have reached higher planes of being,
both of whom assert that the inner nature of THE ALL is UNKNOWABLE.
This must be so, for naught by THE ALL itself can comprehend its own
nature and being.
The Hermetists believe and teach that THE ALL, "in itself," is and must ever
be UNKNOWABLE. They regard all the theories, guesses and speculations of
the theologians and metaphysicians regarding the inner nature of THE ALL,
as but the childish efforts of mortal minds to grasp the secret of the Infinite.
Such efforts have always failed and will always fail, from the very nature of
the task. One pursuing such inquiries travels around and around in the
labyrinth of thought, until he is lost to all sane reasoning, action or conduct,
and is utterly unfitted for the work of life. He is like the squirrel which
frantically runs around and around the circling treadmill wheel of his cage,
traveling ever and yet reaching nowhere--at the end a prisoner still, and
standing just where he started.
And still more presumptuous are those who attempt to ascribe to THE ALL
the personality, qualities, properties, characteristics and attributes of
themselves, ascribing to THE ALL the human emotions, feelings, and
characteristics, even down to the pettiest qualities of mankind, such as
jealousy, susceptibility to flattery and praise, desire for offerings and
worship, and all the other survivals from the days of the childhood of the
race. Such ideas are not worthy of grown men and women, and are rapidly
being discarded.
(At this point, it may be proper for me to state that we make a distinction
between Religion and Theology--between Philosophy and Metaphysics.
Religion, to us, means that intuitional realization of the existence of THE
ALL, and one's relationship to it; while Theology means the attempts of men
to ascribe personality, qualities, and characteristics to it; their theories
regarding its affairs, will, desires, plans, and designs, and their assumption of
22
the office of '' middle-men'' between THE ALL and the people. Philosophy,
to us, means the inquiry after knowledge of things knowable and thinkable;
while Metaphysics means the attempt to carry the inquiry over and beyond
the boundaries and into regions unknowable and unthinkable, and with the
same tendency as that of Theology. And consequently, both Religion and
Philosophy mean to us things having roots in Reality, while Theology and
Metaphysics seem like broken reeds, rooted in the quicksands of ignorance,
and affording naught but the most insecure support for the mind or soul of
Man. we do not insist upon our students accepting these definitions--we
mention them merely to show our position. At any rate, you shall hear very
little about Theology and Metaphysics in these lessons.)
But while the essential nature of THE ALL is Unknowable, there are certain
truths connected with its existence which the human mind finds itself
compelled to accept. And an examination of these reports form a proper
subject of inquiry, particularly as they agree with the reports of the
Illumined on higher planes. And to this inquiry we now invite you.
"THAT which is the Fundamental Truth--the Substantial Reality--is beyond true
naming, but the Wise Men call it THE ALL."--The Kybalion.
"In its Essence, THE ALL is UNKNOWABLE."--The Kybalion.
"But, the report of Reason must be hospitably received, and treated with
respect."--The Kybalion.
The human reason, whose reports we must accept so long as we think at all,
informs us as follows regarding THE ALL, and that without attempting to
remove the veil of the Unknowable:
(1) THE ALL must be ALL that REALLY IS. There can be nothing existing
outside of THE ALL, else THE ALL would not be THE ALL.
(2) THE ALL must be INFINITE, for there is nothing else to define, confine,
bound, limit; or restrict THE ALL. It must be Infinite in Time, or ETERNAL,--it
must have always continuously existed, for there is nothing else to have
ever created it, and something can never evolve from nothing, and if it had
ever "not been," even for a moment, it would not "be" now,--it must
continuously exist forever, for there is nothing to destroy it, and it can never
23
"not-be," even for a moment, because something can never become
nothing. It must be Infinite in Space--it must be Everywhere, for there is no
place outside of THE ALL--it cannot be otherwise than continuous in Space,
without break, cessation, separation, or interruption, for there is nothing to
break, separate, or interrupt its continuity, and nothing with which to "fill in
the gaps." It must be Infinite in Power, or Absolute, for there is nothing to
limit, restrict, restrain, confine, disturb or condition it--it is subject to no
other Power, for there is no other Power.
(3) THE ALL must be IMMUTABLE, or not subject to change in its real nature,
for there is nothing to work changes upon it nothing into which it could
change, nor from which it could have changed. It cannot be added to nor
subtracted from; increased nor diminished; nor become greater or lesser in
any respect whatsoever. It must have always been, and must always remain,
just what it is now--THE ALL--there has never been, is not now, and never
will be, anything else into which it can change.
THE ALL being Infinite, Absolute, Eternal and Unchangeable it must follow
that anything finite, changeable, fleeting, and conditioned cannot be THE
ALL. And as there is Nothing outside of THE ALL, in Reality, then any and all
such finite things must be as Nothing in Reality. Now do not become
befogged, nor frightened--we are not trying to lead you into the Christian
Science field under cover of Hermetic Philosophy. There is a Reconciliation
of this apparently contradictory state of affairs. Be patient, we will reach it
in time.
We see around us that which is called "Matter," which forms the physical
foundation for all forms. Is THE ALL merely Matter? Not at all! Matter cannot
manifest Life or Mind, and as Life and Mind are manifested in the Universe,
THE ALL cannot be Matter, for nothing rises higher than its own source--
nothing is ever manifested in an effect that is not in the cause--nothing is
evolved as a consequent that is not involved as an antecedent. And then
Modern Science informs us that there is really no such thing as Matter--that
what we call Matter is merely "interrupted energy or force," that is, energy
or force at a low rate of vibration. As a recent writer has said "Matter has
melted into Mystery." Even Material Science has abandoned the theory of
Matter, and now rests on the basis of "Energy."
24
Then is THE ALL mere Energy or Force? Not Energy or Force as the
materialists use the terms, for their energy and force are blind, mechanical
things, devoid of Life or Mind. Life and Mind can never evolve from blind
Energy or Force, for the reason given a moment ago: "Nothing can rise
higher than its source--nothing is evolved unless it is involved--nothing
manifests in the effect, unless it is in the cause. " And so THE ALL cannot be
mere Energy or Force, for, if it were, then there would be no such things as
Life and Mind in existence, and we know better than that, for we are Alive
and using Mind to consider this very question, and so are those who claim
that Energy or Force is Everything.
What is there then higher than Matter or Energy that we know to be
existent in the Universe? LIFE AND MIND! Life and Mind in all their varying
degrees of unfoldment! "Then," you ask, "do you mean to tell us that THE
ALL is LIFE and MIND?" Yes! and No! is our answer. If you mean Life and
Mind as we poor petty mortals know them, we say No! THE ALL is not that!
"But what kind of Life and Mind do you mean?" you ask.
The answer is "LIVING MIND," as far above that which mortals know by
those words, as Life and Mind are higher than mechanical forces, or matter--
INFINITE LIVING MIND as compared to finite "Life and Mind." We mean that
which the illumined souls mean when they reverently pronounce the word:
"SPIRIT!"
"THE ALL" is Infinite Living Mind--the Illumined call it SPIRIT!

CHAPTER 7. "THE ALL" IN ALL
"While All is in THE ALL, it is equally true that THE ALL is in ALL. To him who
truly understands this truth hath come great knowledge."--The Kybalion.
How often have the majority of people heard repeated the statement that
their Deity (called by many names) was "All in All" and how little have they
suspected the inner occult truth concealed by these carelessly uttered
words? The commonly used expression is a survival of the ancient Hermetic
Maxim quoted above. As the Kybalion says: "To him who truly understands
this truth, hath come great knowledge." And, this being so, let us seek this
truth, the understanding of which means so much. In this statement of
truth--this Hermetic Maxim--is concealed one of the greatest philosophical,
scientific and religious truths.
We have given you the Hermetic Teaching regarding the Mental Nature of
the Universe--the truth that "the Universe is Mental--held in the Mind of THE
ALL." As the Kybalion says, in the passage quoted above: "All is in THE ALL."
But note also the co-related statement, that: "It is equally true that THE ALL
is in ALL." This apparently contradictory statement is reconcilable under the
Law of Paradox. It is, moreover, an exact Hermetic statement of the
relations existing between THE ALL and its Mental Universe. We have seen
how "All is in THE ALL"--now let us examine the other aspect of the subject.
The Hermetic Teachings are to the effect that THE ALL is Imminent in
("remaining within; inherent; abiding within") its Universe, and in every part,
particle, unit, or combination, within the Universe. This statement is usually
illustrated by the Teachers by a reference to the Principle of
Correspondence. The Teacher instructs the student to form a Mental Image
of something, a person, an idea, something having a mental form, the
favorite example being that of the author or dramatist forming an idea of
his characters; or a painter or sculptor forming an image of an ideal that he
wishes to express by his art. In each case, the student will find that while the
image has its existence, and being, solely within his own mind, yet he, the
student, author, dramatist, painter, or sculptor, is, in a sense, immanent in;
remaining within; or abiding within, the mental image also. In other words,
39
the entire virtue, life, spirit, of reality in the mental image is derived from the
"immanent mind" of the thinker. Consider this for a moment, until the idea
is grasped.
To take a modern example, let us say that Othello, Iago, Hamlet, Lear,
Richard III, existed merely in the mind of Shakespeare, at the time of their
conception or creation. And yet, Shakespeare also existed within each of
these characters, giving them their vitality, spirit, and action. Whose is the
"spirit" of the characters that we know as Micawber, Oliver Twist, Uriah
Heep--is it Dickens, or have each of these characters a personal spirit,
independent of their creator? Have the Venus of Medici, the Sistine
Madonna, the Apollo Belvidere, spirits and reality of their own, or do they
represent the spiritual and mental power of their creators? The Law of
Paradox explains that both propositions are true, viewed from the proper
viewpoints. Micawber is both Micawber, and yet Dickens. And, again, while
Micawber may be said to be Dickens, yet Dickens is not identical with
Micawber. Man, like Micawber, may exclaim: "The Spirit of my Creator is
inherent within me-- and yet I am not HE!" How different this from the
shocking half-truth so vociferously announced by certain of the half-wise,
who fill the air with their raucous cries of: "I am God!" Imagine poor
Micawber, or the sneaky Uriah Heep, crying: "I Am Dickens"; or some of the
lowly clods in one of Shakespeare's plays, eloquently announcing that: "I Am
Shakespeare!" THE ALL is in the earthworm, and yet the earth-worm is far
from being THE ALL. And still the wonder remains, that though the earthworm exists merely as a lowly thing, created and having its being solely
within the Mind of THE ALL--yet THE ALL is immanent in the earthworm, and
in the particles that go to make up the earth-worm. Can there be any greater
mystery than this of "All in THE ALL; and THE ALL in All?"
The student will, of course, realize that the illustrations given above are
necessarily imperfect and inadequate, for they represent the creation of
mental images in finite minds, while the Universe is a creation of Infinite
Mind--and the difference between the two poles separates them. And yet it
is merely a matter of degree--the same Principle is in operation--the Principle
of Correspondence manifests in each--"As above, so Below; as Below, so
above."
40
And, in the degree that Man realizes the existence of the Indwelling Spirit
immanent within his being, so will he rise in the spiritual scale of life. This is
what spiritual development means--the recognition, realization, and
manifestation of the Spirit within us. Try to remember this last definition--
that of spiritual development. It contains the Truth of True Religion.
There are many planes of Being--many sub-planes of Life--many degrees of
existence in the Universe. And all depend upon the advancement of beings
in the scale, of which scale the lowest point is the grossest matter, the
highest being separated only by the thinnest division from the SPIRIT of THE
ALL. And, upward and onward along this Scale of Life, everything is moving.
All are on the Path, whose end is THE ALL. All progress is a Returning Home.
All is Upward and Onward, in spite of all seemingly contradictory
appearances. Such is the message of the Illumined.
The Hermetic Teachings concerning the process of the Mental Creation of
the Universe, are that at the beginning of the Creative Cycle, THE ALL, in its
aspect of Being, projects its Will toward its aspect of "Becoming" and the
process of creation begins. It is taught that the process consists of the
lowering of Vibration until a very low degree of vibratory energy is reached,
at which point the grossest possible form of Matter is manifested. This
process is called the stage of Involution, in which THE ALL becomes
"involved," or "wrapped up," in its creation. This process is believed by the
Hermetists to have a Correspondence to the mental process of an artist,
writer, or inventor, who becomes so wrapped up in his mental creation as to
almost forget his own existence and who, for the time being, almost "lives
in his creation," If instead of "wrapped" we use the word "rapt," perhaps
we will give a better idea of what is meant.
This Involuntary stage of Creation is sometimes called the "Outpouring" of
the Divine Energy, just as the Evolutionary state is called the "Indrawing."
The extreme pole of the Creative process is considered to be the furthest
removed from THE ALL, while the beginning of the Evolutionary stage is
regarded as the beginning of the return swing of the pendulum of Rhythm--
a "coming home" idea being held in all of the Hermetic Teachings.
41
The Teachings are that during the "Outpouring," the vibrations become
lower and lower until finally the urge ceases, and the return swing begins.
But there is this difference, that while in the "Outpouring" the creative
forces manifest compactly and as a whole, yet from the beginning of the
Evolutionary or "Indrawing" stage, there is manifested the Law of
Individualization--that is, the tendency to separate into Units of Force, so
that finally that which left THE ALL as unindividualized energy returns to its
source as countless highly developed Units of Life, having risen higher and
higher in the scale by means of Physical, Mental and Spiritual Evolution.
The ancient Hermetists use the word "Meditation" in describing the process
of the mental creation of the Universe in the Mind of THE ALL, the word
"Contemplation" also being frequently employed. But the idea intended
seems to be that of the employment of the Divine Attention. "Attention" is
a word derived from the Latin root, meaning "to reach out; to stretch out,"
and so the act of Attention is really a mental "reaching out; extension" of
mental energy, so that the underlying idea is readily understood when we
examine into the real meaning of "Attention."
The Hermetic Teachings regarding the process of Evolution are that, THE
ALL, having meditated upon the beginning of the Creation--having thus
established the material foundations of the Universe--having thought it into
existence--then gradually awakens or rouses from its Meditation and in so
doing starts into manifestation the process of Evolution, on the material
mental and spiritual planes, successively and in order. Thus the upward
movement begins--and all begins to move Spiritward. Matter becomes less
gross; the Units spring into being; the combinations begin to form; Life
appears and manifests in higher and higher forms; and Mind becomes more
and more in evidence--the vibrations constantly becoming higher. In short,
the entire process of Evolution, in all of its phases, begins, and proceeds
according to the established "Laws of the Indrawing" process. All of this
occupies aeons upon aeons of Man's time, each aeon containing countless
millions of years, but yet the Illumined inform us that the entire creation,
including Involution and Evolution, of an Universe, is but "as the twinkle of
the eye" to THE ALL. At the end of countless cycles of aeons of time, THE
ALL withdraws its Attention--its Contemplation and Meditation--of the
42
Universe, for the Great Work is finished--and All is withdrawn into THE ALL
from which it emerged. But Mystery of Mysteries--the Spirit of each soul is
not annihilated, but is infinitely expanded--the Created and the Creator are
merged. Such is the report of the Illumined!
The above illustration of the "meditation," and subsequent "awakening
from meditation," of THE ALL, is of course but an attempt of the teachers to
describe the Infinite process by a finite example. And, yet: "As Below, so
Above." The difference is merely in degree. And just as THE ALL arouses
itself from the meditation upon the Universe, so does Man (in time) cease
from manifesting upon the Material Plane, and withdraws himself more and
more into the Indwelling Spirit, which is indeed "The Divine Ego."
There is one more matter of which we desire to speak in this lesson, and
that comes very near to an invasion of the Metaphysical field of speculation,
although our purpose is merely to show the futility of such speculation. We
allude to the question which inevitably comes to the mind of all thinkers
who have ventured to seek the Truth. The question is: "WHY does THE ALL
create Universes" The question may be asked in different forms, but the
above is the gist of the inquiry.
Men have striven hard to answer this question, but still there is no answer
worthy of the name. Some have imagined that THE ALL had something to
gain by it, but this is absurd, for what could THE ALL gain that it did not
already possess? Others have sought the answer in the idea that THE ALL
"wished something to love" and others that it created for pleasure, or
amusement; or because it "was lonely" or to manifest its power;--all puerile
explanations and ideas, belonging to the childish period of thought.
Others have sought to explain the mystery by assuming that THE ALL found
itself "compelled" to create, by reason of its own "internal nature"--its
"creative instinct." This idea is in advance of the others, but its weak point
lies in the idea of THE ALL being "compelled" by anything, internal or
external. If its "internal nature," or "creative instinct," compelled it to do
anything, then the "internal nature" or "creative instinct" would be the
Absolute, instead of THE ALL, and so accordingly that part of the
proposition falls. And, yet, THE ALL does create and manifest, and seems to
43
find some kind of satisfaction in so doing. And it is difficult to escape the
conclusion that in some infinite degree it must have what would correspond
to an "inner nature," or "creative instinct," in man, with correspondingly
infinite Desire and Will. It could not act unless it Willed to Act; and it would
not Will to Act, unless it Desired to Act and it would not Desire to Act unless
it obtained some Satisfaction thereby. And all of these things would belong
to an "Inner Nature," and might be postulated as existing according to the
Law of Correspondence. But, still, we prefer to think of THE ALL as acting
entirely FREE from any influence, internal as well as external. That is the
problem which lies at the root of difficulty--and the difficulty that lies at the
root of the problem.
Strictly speaking, there cannot be said to be any "Reason" whatsoever for
THE ALL to act, for a "reason" implies a "cause," and THE ALL is above Cause
and Effect, except when it Wills to become a Cause, at which time the
Principle is set into motion. So, you see, the matter is Unthinkable, just as
THE ALL is Unknowable. Just as we say THE ALL merely "IS"--so we are
compelled to say that "THE ALL ACTS BECAUSE IT ACTS." At the last, THE
ALL is All Reason in Itself; All Law in Itself; All Action in Itself--and it may be
said, truthfully, that THE ALL is Its Own Reason; its own Law; its own Act--or
still further, that THE ALL; Its Reason; Its Act; is Law; are ONE, all being
names for the same thing. In the opinion of those who are giving you these
present lessons, the answer is locked up in the INNER SELF of THE ALL,
along with its Secret of Being. The Law of Correspondence, in our opinion,
reaches only to that aspect of THE ALL, which may be spoken of as "The
Aspect of BECOMING." Back of that Aspect is "The Aspect of BEING" in
which all Laws are lost in LAW; all Principles merge into PRINCIPLE--and THE
ALL; PRINCIPLE; and BEING; are IDENTICAL, ONE AND THE SAME. Therefore,
Metaphysical speculation on this point is futile. We go into the matter here,
merely to show that we recognize the question, and also the absurdity of
the ordinary answers of metaphysics and theology.
In conclusion, it may be of interest to our students to learn that while some
of the ancient, and modern, Hermetic Teachers have rather inclined in the
direction of applying the Principle of Correspondence to the question, with
the result of the "Inner Nature" conclusion,--still the legends have it that
44
HERMES, the Great, when asked this question by his advanced students,
answered them by PRESSING HIS LIPS TIGHTLY TOGETHER and saying not a
word, indicating that there WAS NO ANSWER. But, then, he may have
intended to apply the axiom of his philosophy, that: "The lips of Wisdom are
closed, except to the ears of Understanding," believing that even his
advanced students did not possess the Understanding which entitled them
to the Teaching. At any rate, if Hermes possessed the Secret, he failed to
impart it, and so far as the world is concerned THE LIPS OF HERMES ARE
CLOSED regarding it. And where the Great Hermes hesitated to speak, what
mortal may dare to teach?
But, remember, that whatever be the answer to this problem, if indeed
there be an answer the truth remains that: "While All is in THE ALL, it is
equally true that THE ALL is in All." The Teaching on this point is emphatic.
And, we may add the concluding words of the quotation: "To him who truly
understands this truth, hath come great knowledge."
