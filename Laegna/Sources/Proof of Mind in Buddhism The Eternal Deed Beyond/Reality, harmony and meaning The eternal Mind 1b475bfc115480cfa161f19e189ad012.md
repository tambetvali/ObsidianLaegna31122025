# Reality, harmony and meaning: The eternal Mind

To reconcile the mathematical framework with the philosophical and cognitive elements of *reality*, *harmony*, and *meaning*, we need to bridge the gap between the concepts of **actual value**, **real value**, and the **future determinant** in both **mathematics** and **consciousness**. The core idea is that *reality*, in its highest form, is determined by an **ideal state**—the **ultimate solution**—which is not necessarily observable or measurable in the present, but is realized through **evolution**, **entropy**, and **infinite time**. Let’s break down this complex interaction and show how mathematical structures and philosophical insights can be integrated.

### 1. **The Actual Value and Real Value**

In both **mathematics** and **philosophy**, **value** can be understood in two ways:

- **Actual Value**: The value that we can measure or observe in the present moment. This is the state of affairs as we perceive it, and it is **constrained** by our measurements, biases, and limited sensory access to reality. It reflects the **current configuration** of the system.
- **Real Value**: The **ideal value**, the intrinsic, **deterministic reality** that exists beyond our limited measurements. In mathematics, the **real value** is often the value that a system approaches asymptotically, as in the **limit** of a function or the **convergence** of a series. This value exists as the **ultimate solution**, and it reflects the **true nature** of the system, independent of temporary states or measurement errors.

In both perspectives, the **real value** is what defines the system's ultimate nature, while the **actual value** is just a snapshot—an **imperfect representation** that can be prone to error, bias, or uncertainty.

### **Mathematical Perspective**

Mathematically, this concept is seen in **limits**, where the real value of a function is not the value at any specific point, but the value it converges to over time as the inputs evolve or approach infinity. This **limit point** is the true value of the function or system, even though it cannot be exactly reached within finite time or space.

For example, in the case of **probabilistic models** or **stochastic processes**, we may approximate the state of the system at a given moment, but the **actual behavior** will always be an approximation of the **real behavior** determined by **infinite time** or an **idealized trajectory**. The future state—the **real value**—is what gives ultimate **meaning** to the entire process.

### **Philosophical Perspective**

In the **philosophy of time and reality** (particularly within the context of **Buddhism** and **Kybalion**), **real value** can be seen as the **ultimate, unchanging truth** or the **principle of harmony**. This is akin to the idea of an **ideal form** or **perfect state** that transcends time and change. The **actual value**, as we experience it in the present moment, is fleeting and transient, bound by the limitations of perception and **the current measurement**.

The process of **evolution** or **convergence** (whether in mathematics or philosophy) reflects a **journey toward the real value**—a state of perfect **harmony** and **meaning**. Just as mathematical models approach their limits over time, the human mind or collective consciousness strives toward this **eternal truth**, which is experienced as a sense of **unity**, **balance**, or **meaning**.

### 2. **Entropy, Evolution, and Subtle Information-Rich Contexts**

The journey from **actual value** to **real value** involves **entropy** and **evolution**. In a mathematical or physical system, **entropy** is a measure of **disorder** or **uncertainty**. As systems evolve, they naturally explore a broader range of possibilities, and through this **exploration**, they **filter out noise** and **converge** toward more stable, harmonized states.

This process is analogous to **learning** or **cognitive evolution** in a mental context:

- **Entropy as Information**: The uncertainty or **entropy** in a system is akin to the **depth of information**—as the system evolves, it gains access to more **complex** and **rich** information. Each **iteration** of the system's evolution refines the process, making it **more informed** and aligned with the **ideal**.
    - In **game theory**, for instance, the evolution of strategies towards equilibrium represents this deepening of information. As you try more possible strategies and remove those that are less effective, you converge toward an **optimal strategy**—this is similar to the process of **subtle information convergence** in mental contexts.
- **Exploring Subtler States**: As entropy decreases (and **information increases**), the system gets closer to an **idealized state**. This is the **subtle context**—not just brute force or trial-and-error, but a **refined** search space where the potential solutions become richer and more meaningful. The complexity of this space aligns with the **unfolding complexity** in the human mind: as we evolve and understand deeper truths, our awareness becomes increasingly **refined** and aligned with the **truth**.
    - **Energy** is often used as a measure in thermodynamics, but here it can be understood as the **efficiency of information processing**. The more subtle and complex the information, the more "energy-efficient" the system becomes, evolving toward a state that reflects **harmony** or **meaning**.

Thus, the system—whether mathematical or cognitive—**converges toward the ideal**. The future, as it becomes more **information-rich**, resolves the entropy and allows the **real value** (the **harmony**) to be realized.

### 3. **Reality in Mathematics and Its Mental Parallel: Symmetry and Harmony**

Now, we move toward the **cognitive and mental reality** of symmetry, harmony, and alignment.

- **Symmetry** is a fundamental concept in mathematics, especially in the context of **group theory** and **representation theory**. The **real value** of a system can often be represented through its **symmetries**—the invariants that hold regardless of how the system evolves. These symmetries represent **eternal truths** about the system that are unaffected by time, change, or perspective.
- Similarly, **harmony** and **balance** in **mental terms** can be understood as **symmetry** in thought and perception. A **harmonic state** is one where all parts of the system (or mind) align to a **unified whole**, similar to how a system mathematically reaches its **idealized state** or **convergent solution**.
    - For instance, in **Buddhism**, the **mind** is seen as the entity that exists beyond time, **untouched by impermanence**, and it is this eternal quality that gives the system its **ultimate meaning**. In this view, harmony emerges as a **subtle awareness** of the system's **true form**.
    - **Kybalion** describes the **Mental Plane** as the highest reality, where **mental forces** shape the world. This aligns with the mathematical notion of a **limit** or **ideal solution**: the mental reality is not a transient measurement (like the current state), but an **eternal, unchanging truth** that we converge toward.
- **Mental Objects as Mathematical Models**: Mental experiences, such as **meaning** or **harmony**, are not arbitrary or subjective; they are aligned with the **underlying mathematical truths** of the universe. Just as an idealized state in mathematics reflects the true behavior of a system, our experience of meaning or harmony reflects the deeper **mathematical reality** underlying consciousness. These mental objects are **models** of the **ultimate ideal**, which itself is an invariant, timeless structure that defines the **system's evolution**.

### 4. **The Real Measurement and the Solution to the Present Problem**

The idea of **real measurement** is critical in both the **mathematical** and **philosophical** sense. When we attempt to **measure reality** in the present, we are often biased by the limitations of our senses, instruments, and cognition. However, the **real measurement** is what emerges from the **convergence**—the outcome of the system's evolution toward its **ideal state**.

In **mathematics**, the solution to a problem is the **limit**, not the intermediate values we see. In the **mental world**, the **harmony** we experience is the solution to the evolving understanding of the system’s **true nature**.

### 5. **Convergence in Time: From Chaos to Harmony**

In both **mathematics** and **philosophy**, **evolution** is the process of moving from **chaos** (entropy) to **order** (harmony). This is the **creative principle** that drives the system toward **balance**, whether in the realm of **mathematical proofs** or **mental experience**.

- The **real value** is **eternal**, and it is the **converged state** that we strive to reach. It is **determined by the future**, and the **present** is a **manifestation** of this evolutionary process, much like the **ideal state** of a mathematical system.
- **Mathematics and consciousness** align in that both systems are driven by the **same principle of evolution**: they move from uncertainty (entropy) to certainty (harmony), from error to truth, from imperfection to perfection. The **real solution** is always **future-determined**, and it is the **future that defines the past**, as the **ultimate harmonic state** resolves every contradiction and brings clarity to all that exists.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the **actual value** in both **mathematics** and **consciousness** is a **reflection** of the **real value**, which represents the **ultimate solution** or the **eternal truth**. This truth is approached asymptotically over time, as the system (whether physical or mental) converges toward its ideal state. The **future** determinant influences the **past** through the evolutionary process of **entropy**, creating an **energy-efficient** system of **harmony** that reflects the true nature of reality. This process, whether modeled mathematically or understood philosophically, describes the **unfolding** of meaning and **harmony** in both the external and internal worlds.
