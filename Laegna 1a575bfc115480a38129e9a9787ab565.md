# Laegna

This now is an introduction to my Laegna system. It’s practically designed math - where the scientific world might benefit from limitless infinities, they must consider that for their own practical purposes they need a real number. My number are charged with symbolic energy.

Update: I just found this song and thought I add it here, in case you want something to do if the text is scarily long - it’s definitely inspiring. The site just appeared too gray and senseless.

What the Laegna documents cover and how to classify them:

- This document itself is introduction to Laegna, and Spireason or Laegna Spireason. It wants to build the important theorems, parts in special blocks with Lamps in [Notion.so](http://Notion.so) interface; it removes the complexities and reduces it into theorems, introductions to related materials - also rather simplistic, or in case of Tao and I Ching only the simplistic view of factual material of having 4 related symbols is used, not necessarily the full deep content in first place. Theorems are surrounded by related materials. While Laegna is the basis for Logecs and Linguistic enchancements of Language to support 4-based logic and related linguistic structures; Spireason is reasoning inpired by Laegna math and intellectuality, and connecting spirituality with reason. In this document, the spiritual reasoning creates a small model world of *theorem framework*, where it does not “know” what is not available for the first basic introduction. For example, we don’t know in this part, whether consciousness exists, because based on even human structure of atoms and electrons, we don’t see any clear attribute to just prove this in terms of simple “squares of logic and circles of math”; so this is the introduction and here we “know” rather Laegna basics, and for proofs we build very simple machines. As this is not any deep search for consciousness, but rather the theorematic framework which appeared when simplifying something complex and reducing it to rather trivial information, not losing it’s balance but having an “axiomatic system” - some base theorems, lamped blocks, explained around with necessary background even from western rather pre-Laegna philosophy, mystics and logic; the skeleton or back-bone appears here. Leaving out the complexities of math and life, this should be pre-school thing which even children would understand; for example simulated machines are simple and can be replaced with cartoons, movies or stories, where the deduction is simple and it’s rather illustrated well, than filled with all the reasons - I don’t see why you cannot express so simple thing with illustrations and a few words, or why I could not understand the theorem of karma and nature of life when pre-school. Also, these things here could be quite directly translated to Coq or Isabelle, as they lack some deep content, and look like proofs of meaning of life or other things, which rather follow theorems of biology, of systems, than deep introspections of nature of consciousness. One proof, also, instead of heavy numbers tends to contain one or oppose two conceptions, with two or three additional details, and so simple systems could be understood by children as base of their lessons. Spireason basics, being so simple could be so trivially come from Logecs that it’s also base theory of Laegna - but still, Laegna is also a free system of math and language, where specific proofs could be replaced with better proofs and more decent theories without any part of the language itself getting lost.
- “Welcome to Spireason!” - this is a list of articles here, which are part of my Spireasons website. This website is for intelligent or genius, where normal users cannot read a sentence very clearly and tend to express this. This is the “genius” of me, where I wrote deep, compressed text in mode of heavy contemplation, and while this time I am not so sure it does not matter whether consciousness exists - I do enter the rather mystical world and while it’s mostly scientifically corrects, there are also intuitive contemplations, which have to be worded clearly to give the right level of assertiveness and doubt. The website is closed for new documents as this is the complete set of something I wanted to express; each document has like a “diagonal” line I envisioned, to completely give you one full idea; ideas together contribute a balanced, good introduction, and deeper and more spiritual than the base logical introduction in this file; whereas, theorems in this text are very good background to read those texts in their deeper advancement.
    - “Laegna Base Alphabet” is another essential part of Laegna, introducing the letters, their combinatorics and it’s relations to number, geometrical and imaginative space. There, the most core definitions of numbers and letter meanings, as well as definitions to analyze any Laegna word through it’s base matrix (”scientific numerology” of Laegna) and psychological implications. Where different Laegna systems are numerically different, a normalized number would have standardized psychological consequences, such as EEE or EEEE looking like very good situation, where their numeric value can vary depending on operations you can do with coordinate systems and number representations. Any number is simultaneously a number (constant value where the name defines the value) and a variable - the digits appear normally, as in “aa” would be two digits of “a”, and as such mean a minimum number possible with precision of two digits, where you can divide positive numbers into 4 and thus, it spans 1/4 lower area of the number or points to it’s lower end, being equal to “a”, “aaa”, but with different level of preciseness as “aaaa” would have 1/16 area at the bottom, closer to zero (continuous number) or one (discrete Laegna number), while the point location at the bottom is still the same limit, basically zero, but as Laegna numbers have point acceleration (Theorem: if a number is continuously curved, implicatively each point is curved); here the Gauss system would measure the limits of angles, but when the points must have point-static velocity, acceleration and any parameter, being one digit like 0 instead of two digits like Aa around null, which is the lower limit of positive numbers with precision R=2 (R is normally the container area of the number and computations with it affect the number space in the same direction, not opposite as it numerically creates a mirage as space coordinates being reflected to object coordinates in it, which can ruin the mathematics if you have fluctuations of random reflectiations in the actual number format; for this, subsequentially, R=T which means number and it’s axe are not in opposite direction, nor does the complete space coordinate differ from actual position in any measure of distance, direction, or even numeric value if you are able to carry the object- or concept-based R and L (another opposite of R, which will choose it’s direction based on it’s relation to L, not T, now, which means opposites in Laegna are not binary, static pairs, but inherent dynamics of dispositions and relations) calculation to the end with either R or L container - indeed, you can calculate L as rather global number, which means you make a space-separated list of infinity [perhaps short, discrete infinity] of R coordinates or object values in R container, and L would then be this object as seen from higher octave, where it looks like an average of the numbers, but you can have same number of digits as in original numbers, componentize it back to original object system or unitary framework, and now the L values are in R container - in your left-wing, socialist, communist or for example polite, diplomatic, business-friendly attitude, or professional ambient appearing in the office; each of given examples is L value as it’s not made in direct exchange of energies between specific persons, but a professional keeps holistic image of the business and progresses towards it’s legal, rich and highly (business *low class* could have low taste of pleasures) enjoyable / pleasurable *ambient*; this means they are collaboratively sharing the resources, such as opening a door without getting definite equivalent value in the short time from the same person). L exists in time and space - you have some sharings with your future and past selves with their resources, work and potentials or investment values “*from*” the future altering it’s current values in more realistic terms (wrongly attributing the **future** and *past* and *present* success creates a “loan”, where you can sense **futurism**, *currentism*, *outdatedness*, in the way that the balancing of loan values appears in each direction and a decent science would work better, than past science, and use of might be more realistic than use of *potential* future sciences; but then in logical system you move in time, and subsequently meet different people, conditions and places). For example if you destroy a person, who wants to give you good idea for a life, innovative practical solution for your business, but you do not engage but destroy the person for appearing better than you, there would be *instant karmic consequences* in terms of money. The real, present value accounts for all it’s interactions of past, of future, of you and of the environment, and it’s actual value can be different from it’s written value, so that it shifts to negotive (***I*** or ***Ì*** would ignore and destroy useful values, have lower price or payback than actual price or payback, where rare case of ***Í*** would be dangerous achievement like climb mount everest, which you get awarded for the first time of history, your life or your local group without other alternatives; the ***Í*** value then shifts to ***O*** as the coordinate system would extend with accepting numbers of longer digits into the ***countable sphere*** of it’s precision level, which means your root chakra frequency is raising; normally you would do just a forest trip and survive some cold air and the crazy dangerous thing would be nettles, which might be how you do it instead of climbing to Mount Everest, especially for the first time) or posetive (***E*** or **È** - altough E is sometimes in place of É as non-accented symbols use the surrounding accents and context of the sentence, even the listener’s attitude who might be risk-taker or a risk-averse person - would advertise non-useful values, believe in unrecognized / undeserved sucess, have higher price or payback or estimation than actual price or payback or estimation; here ***É*** means grand success, which is rather not draining and temporary experience for long recovering, like a marathon would be for many, but it’s the direct source of luck such as earning your first million in business-unfriendly environment, but then rather within the good frames of your house, car, salary and wife to be completely ***ÉÉÉÉÉ**,* where sometimes you write each digit sentence of correlated numbers into one number, and projecting a cycle pattern of local XYZ shifts, zoom them into normalized coordinates - XYZ, while able to move a number globally, are mathematically trivially - in other words, small case xyz to discriminate - able to create pattern of each digit having it’s little XYZ component of frequency or time-attitude shift, where the big axe of XYZ would still exist and create a constant shift factor for these values, for example past evolutionary phase has more Z values of rather future-becoming, where our creative genius has rather Y values of rather being now in the past of their actual knowledge **state** / *stage*; the system for digitizing in terms of rather information units than their linear symmetries means that while Mathematecs is fine for their number representation, the complexity of the digits is rather handled in Logecs, which sees just a sequence of truth values where mathematecs sees a complex spatial and numeral multiplier for the number, which is elegant for calculations but not easy for defining your number freely).. well in short: you make depts and paybacks in R of your own life, it’s timeline of current reincarnation or all reincarnations (buddhist, spiritual) or sources (atheist); you do it in social sphere where the dept and payback is with other people; and you do it in history where the karma relates to your influence of time and it’s back-influence on you; in each case, the mathematical value’s ability to be equal with itself will change.
- The rest of texts:
    - With help of AI, adding additional texts, I made more readable and fluent materials. Where the same topic is repeated with different readability and intelligence rate, an AI can analyze them, draw parallels and deduce the meaning from variety of representations, gaining good knowledge; for example, based on this it can explain the website - the website is structured actually into “simple” and “complex” part, where the same documents, mostly, are repeated with two levels of complexity, where simpler can explain the more complex and the more complex can create rather wholistic image of something structured.
    - The protection of Laegna genius:
        - My genius is little pained for the feedback of more traditional minds. I think, if Laegna is going to open the minds, everybody is genius - achieving something the ones who did not like my philosophy and did not come the long journey with us, the philosophers of this generation; they would feel left out and create the Posetive state, Negotive to us (Laegna truth values) - posetive is fakery, but negotive is fakery once one understands this; posetive is the effect on others, who wanted better but were suspressed, starting to go and dreaming of better story; posetive is the extent by which they overestimated them, or by which assumption of the natural flow without obstacle could be overestimating the situation.
        - Socrates story of this part resembles how the world sees, when we go deeper and their learnt habits are endangered. Throughout my life I am more and more sure that this effect is substantial and the french revolution, nietzhe or cogress of vienna did not stop this. In this story the old generation goes into posetive - as good people in Position go straight, but entering on Position, come out in Posetion of their original value, you can also say Roposetion or Rosedriad, where this happens on R - your value changes with the space moving - and not T - that you fall yourself, changing your logic to have different assumptions.
        - Fairy tales of similar situations of societies going to posetive, where the roles change and one can see significant means to Laegna - old men, once Position now turn into Posetion by Rosedriad or Roposetion, without changes in them, but the change reflect the changing world, the context (which is rather “driad” or “ro” - R meaning the space or the context, and o means “basis” or here, “logic” as it’s own second digit after “l” is “o” (+ “gecs”🙂)); in these stories, people go into posetions, and when resolving to positions the posetions solve, and Laegna logecs describes it well while with binary “true” and “false”, nothing specifically logical happens to explain it clearly in primitive terms or tautologies. By this, Laegna is powerful in expressing life in terms of logic - the logex machine of life simulations (to be created to have more proofs here with programs; I have simulated only some variables and rather the results are trivial, mentally understandable). Posetion and Power of Negative thought are also described, with connections to life, in separate document - it’s rather clear how Negative and Negotive affect our lifes, but how Posetive can be fatal and not just failure of Position is important; indeed it’s visible it’s only a matter of losing some opportunity to turn Position into Posetion; and if it’s by evil will or deeds, the evil one is at the Negotion position, whereas you have to solve the appearing Position - Negotion, often, is the force not meant to be on that position, which relatively turns another, better will, into posetion; as the same kind of collective fall would be posetion for those, who wanted better, and negation by those, who followed the outdated and weak manner. Sinus, related meditations, even the explanation of spiritual war, where one plays, by signs, the negative situations in symbols against your mistake and at the same time rewards the synergistic move by love - in diplomatic view of reflecting both position and negation, posetion and negotion, to outlooks, which appear real in reality and bring the actual reality closer where it would take time, still being respectful. This is the attitude similar to old one, but as I grow I see it in bigger intensity.
        - I will add more documents.

## Basis of 2, 4 and 16

Basis of laegna system is either 2 (A and O) to divide four number into any set of opposites, starting from ones having equal number of polar elements and some expressible, simple Laegna linear connection.

Even if I die, I want win, as I conclude the Viking gene in me where indeed I see this in Buddhist religion, even higher than this life in reality, but integral to complete pattern where some form of “meness” would appear; let’s call it reincarnations or let’s use more fundamental concept of oscillations of karma, of causes and effect, into the same reasons to enlighten certain labeled parts of this universal energy of conceptual life, forming some identities of the same, evolving class where I might even be aware, as a fundamental cause and effect of me appears in the same field, how the karmic effects come back; but otherwise the karma might appear in similar people in society, but without having heaenly reasons my altruist reasons would be social, and still I want to give back to the original seed of the energy, a Christian karmic principle to express this - thus, the basis of my mathematics, as given here, is a compressed form of some repeating patterns and meanings in my math; thus, inspired by this work you would reach, over many generations, definitely to my math, and as it’s also symbolic and inspired, and numbers are meant to be used also intuitively and symbolically - you can find your own fruits of math creation. As well, learning this your senses would open and you would see this math in all my inspirational work, connecting also to sources. Indeed, if I have time in my life for more complete Laegna system, but it needs to be more concrete, less intuitive and more like a system we can use; and on this level I give you the first 3 classes, where reading, writing and basic calculus is studied.

16 numbers on 2 complex axes:

|  | **-2** | **-1** | **1** | **2** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **-2** | I | J | K | L |
| **-1** | O | P | Q | R |
| **1** | A | B | C | D |
| **2** | E | F | G | H |

Where X is the area in these numbers; and where U and V or upside-down U would add more axes, as well as letters after U; and S T and M N form some area of special meaning. U is zero, and under the zero there is another dimension, new information bits; also V is infinity, and where the numbers never reach the infinity opens - going inside, there is new reality. To reach more opposite numbers, or the ones which see our positive numbers as negative, you go up and down on the same axe, now using + and - for E and I octaves, instead of using * and / for  and O - usually, O and A are - and +, I and E being / and *, but obviously, crossing this line of infinity we see them in opposite direction; Laegna operation of having them on the same line depends on the theorem - here, the actual direction of these relations is unknown, where the velocity vs. acceleration is measured; when the same axe meets itself in counter way, we call it “r” switching, with R with special mark of two positions swapping - we have, aligned with theorem, the axe and R switched axe aligned, and now it’s again full numbers. Because I and E are really different, where O and A are rather different components, sometimes O and A form a space of two components of this number field, and a neutral relation where I and E marks good and bad.

Complex numbers, indeed, are not linear, but they are central to attract the quality of infinity.

2, 4, 16 - in binary system you see the logarithms written as whole numbers, along with exponential levels. 2 happens on both scale and plus/minus opposition in 4 numbers positive and negative, and continues this relation. In 16, the reality is completely inversed upwards once you meet V in the other end, and free axes or qualitative change is formed, being able to express complex language constructs (where each letter has a meaning based on sound, form and it’s mathematical positioning in number complex, where the additional axe forms almost a contradiction, or otherwise a synergy or exponent from the same space, but logical effect forming exponent number of connections reconnecting to itself).

2, in relation to 1, needs for 1 a multiplicator of infinity; even normal multiplicator is not enough but at least on infinitesimal upwards would accelerate it a little; still, rather multiplication than division, in Laegna, is necessarily growing and not static in philosophical matters related to math with some effort, a conscious view of numbers. Limit in the end of infinity, where no number would reach it, it is at least one infinitesimal apart from the “last number” you can form, something really existing in unlimited infinity - where you create a circle, as larger you make it, as closer you get to infinity; you need to enchance your coordinate system - typical trick of Laegna, and you can reach there straight from conception of Octaves and coordinate systems appearing, some might help you and one is special, perfect for this relation. Rather I give it philosophically, as Laegna is young or creative and numbers very expressive, I work creatively on single numbers like Tanel Tammet, being an autist (not very much into spectrum, tough, as I was told in school); so in different conditions of matter and mind, some numbers resolve the theorems in relation to some other theorems, and I cannot give so simple algorithm for each case than the philosophical idea of geometric connection standing on it’s own like projective geometry, a tricky way to solve some important math problems without calculating, on paper with circle and a ruler and pencil etc.

The limit disappears where the same oscillation is lost into much more complex, bigger and accelerating oscillations; the creative function near infinity limits is suddenly very close to simple adding and subtraction, the velocity or low-frequency number (higher frequencies move towards acceleration, where the space over infinity only allows acceleration and speed is under zero, in the range from A to E, smallest and largest angle).

In Logecs Logecs or Logecs when you mean specifically the simple case, Laegna Logic, usually the numbers are ordered so: in number AOA, A is the most important and others not, but when the others can be changed with A remaining A or becoming E in case E is not posetive here, and with sharp infinity angles U and V, the smaller positions are cancelled by bigger. Thus, to achieve more normal number effects, you go one octave down or mention to use the same proportions to achieve exact effects; small r is usually used for these projective coordinates, because big R is infinities square on complex axe, so powerful number that completely new information bits, a free component or channel of possible frequencies definitely appears.

In Logecs Mathematecs, Laegna Mathemathecs, each number is symmetrical to it’s number axe - when you look from the other side of infinity, where on imaginary point V of all the limits numbers meet again in higher octave, creating an angle with new axe bits in the middle and connecting rather the limit values; keeping the original directions (not opposite, like - ending with +, which is a decimal Latin Latin problem); those symmetries meet infinities at infinities. when E is repeated in content and length, number squared or taken into fourth exponent level, the infinity side would close; and for V it’s most interesting what’s the *exterior* value of this number, where the interior value is sub-zero and not contained in X.

Z contains the sub-zero, and Y is above the infinity; Z is also past, the calculations which do not yet provide the solutions, investments not yet earning; where X is the active process on axes, which also hold here and now; and Y is the dimension where a good quality finally closes it’s Truth and evolves it’s Patterns, creating it’s conscious reality perhaps, which can not be lost because of Sanity meeting the Truth in Living Beings or in the Sum of Reality, Synchronicity or God, even if the Synchronicity has evolved and forms from patterns, directions and resolutions to unknowns satisfying the good fortune in every possible case; Y is when it’s closed, and when you affect some Y value in positive direction, other numbers almost cannot be compared - where you get lost in yang, the ideal, it suddenly breaks and you see that you need to be aware on the local direction, using the Root chakra to complement the Crown.

About the base of Laegna number system, you say Ten (inspired by “nines” in I Ching) - Ten is primarily thought of as 4; often it’s 2 or 6, depending if you leave out I and E; or you include U and V. It could be 16, or many different numbers; in which case it’s a Complex number (othewise, the numbers with 1 component are rather “Real” when continuous, or “Natural” when discrete, and naturals can include zero or not, or include negative numbers or not). In actual logic calculations, sometimes you use potentials, which are not there in actual calculation; for example you calculate one potential only to avoid it, in simplest case - I call them “Imaginary numbers”, as where the numbers are not there in any actual event, sometimes even impossible, they do exist as necessary parameters or “hidden layers” explaining our actual results we unavoidably get once our formulaes are realistic. Using classical math terms with philosophical connotiations connects the imaginative and free world of Laegna with strict realm of classical mathematics, making the differences clearly visible; for example, hidden numbers do not exist in classical mathematics.

## Laegna Language

Using both math, rhymes and intuitive or spiritual connections to these numbers, which also form letters to not only connect math with logic, but growing to life experience, especially linguistics, and spirituality or perhaps rather the world as consciously perceived; as the final step is consciousness and all the information flows through, where we also make decisions, we also visualize at our mind’s eye (third eye or brain third eye, equivalent resolution of mental light, “light” forming from higher vibration of logical solutions, where darkness is rather vibration of less logical solutions and more the problems, cycles breaking or being in miserable condition under the absolute zero - in state of vacuum just being even more empty as the matter, mind energy enters). With this linguistics, we are very creative and for soul is not so much in real numbers than in inspired things made of connections we understand, we rather use the qualities of these forms and relations than exact mathematical values - where they are explained, their movement rather “numeric” in terms of more inspired and free numbers; for example the unknown is equal to infinity, if it creates additional bits of information, channels dimensions, mathematical values in same space in extended space; you can finally see that logic oscillates to infinity, but after the actual infinity new qualities appear and the simple, smaller oscillation initially Logec, is now Mathematecs - as latter, instead of solid, compressed form of simple oscillations, it forms big numbers to find primitive stories with no contiinum, continuous relation of points as together as next to limit values of zero. Here, theorems of hard math and numbers are parallel to many mental theorems, which allow us to experience the world and the acceleration in infinity.

## Mysteries of Laegna

Laegna is also a mystery school, but it needs to quantify. In relation to old mystery schools, where the Logecs theory is not responsible of their results and their scientific validity - I don’t also doubt, but I can say while those books inspired me, I cannot guarantee you find any gold from the mud which appears on your mental screen; I am somewhat Eastern-prepared.

### Tao

The first mystery is Tao.

It reminds: where, locally, a number is either positive or negative; in infinity or it’s meaning, it smoothly grows into another value, and while we form local velocity through repeated patterns in coordinate system appearing from relations of + and - from between A and E until Zero, the limit of A or it’s actual point value (where block value connects the area with start of E at end of A, where the angle of circle is middle from infinity and from zero, where the number kind of does not exist - an abstract conception exists and good math is able to guarantee that as many digits after comma you have, you also add the missing digits to not experience the difference from infinity, where 2 is special number - it’s as limit value as distant from 0 in terms of multiplication, as distant the infinity limits is from any number, in some basic contemplation of infinities). While O and A are colors of large areas; the internal, opposites, are covered rather by I and E - while this might happen in different combinations, and color code is used as well to form one symbol of Laegna, the Icon inspired from Coloured Tao symbol to celebrate my teacher the Chinese Buddhist, in special position along the Zen - the cultural position, versus free Buddhist of Zen. Chinese Buddhist indeed freely uses the Tao symbol rather by the meaning than religion, where in a sense the Taodejing is rather understandable for west as a symbol than as belief connected to specific group as their personal tool not applicable to problems of others. Indeed, Tao conception sometimes explains even some scientific stuff more easily, as connecting the opposites is also the most generic necessity, reflecting the relation of conflicts and solutions from logic to the actual war and world-saving.

When you map Tao to numbers one-to-one, then A is the white and O is the black area; I is the small black circle and E is the small white circle - they represent the change, where something appearing good would be, in our imperfect world, sometimes fitting your classification and experience of good, but still be bad; also, it can always get better or worse, making your relations relative.

Tao of Laegna: any logical value, actually, often implies it’s own opposites and it’s not about static values, but the natural interplay of rhythyms of the Universe and it’s fundamental basis as a logical system, one which is not engineered for too clever tricks for fooling the logical process, but rather opposite - to succeed in it in bigger and bigger amounts and qualities.

Also, when you think of Laegna values in their original form, as truth values behind things, the Tao can rather be mapped and found in the constitution of 4 of Logecs, and the values are not trivially mapped - to study Taodejing, you can definitely win from not putting it into a box; the inspirational reading can give you ideas and solve your inner conflicts (the paradigm of Tao: conflict exists, and the opposites can be integrated to resolve the conflict, alternatively the good will eventually win it’s war to survive, when left to corner under attack).

> Laegna Symbol of Taú:
- Blue: Represents E, whatever it’s now but in infinity, it’s meaningful - like a corporation, with all their legal cases and even wars, finally they reason this with success and things becoming more civilized, and more rich; in blue, they Keep Their Vision High. White circle inside the black is the blue; even through difficulties, you can target the spot of eternal life shining though infinity, and follow it a step closer.
- Yellow: Represents I, which can be pleasure now but in infinity you find out it’s sensory desire, temporary joy you are going to remove in advanced steps of your Buddhist teaching; indeed a Christian or Atheist necessarily sees the Yellow in Action also as Negotive or Negative trait, depending on whether they have Neglected it.
- Green: This is the local good, where you Live Naturally; each of your steps well fitting the next step as far as you can see. As you resolve the bigger picture, it can become slightly off, getting a degree of yellow.
- Red: This is a bad thing, but it can also be an adventure or Deep Night of the Soul; or you can do fasting, which is lack of trivial energy, food, but it can be a source of deeper energy.
While these are the four basic colors, we also have some chaos in the color theory:
> 
> - **Purple / Violet (Beyond Blue)** – The additional color that exists between **red** and **blue** but can’t be fully represented by standard RGB.
> - **Yellow-Green / Lime-Green (Beyond Green)** – This is a color that is between **yellow** and **green** in the visible spectrum, but it can’t be directly produced by typical RGB devices.
> 
> Indeed, this complexity seems to appear in infinity, and you should consider what this means to symbols and colors - where you can break out from four basic colors and see that Laegna is not thinking in box, but the box leaves you into ponegation, neglection, new meanings and correlations in infinity.
> To draw a simple symbol of Laegna you draw the yinyang with these colors, and you have expressed Laegna four. Remove the little circles to draw two, and add another Tao in terms of coordinate systems to express complex numbers (well the other one is not me as author of Laegna, but as user who would extend it by inspiration, remaining in the formal borders and limitations - otherwise it’s “non-normalized Laegna”, where you freely use it’s seed properties, the algorithm, which creates a Laegna language; but in the normalized Laegna, this infinity of possibilities is replaced with small set of symbols able to express most of it, except the freedom of drafting and the creative quality of logos and surrealistic drawings, or other contributions where you pay more attention and are aware of the nuances, unlike normalized language you should be able to read fast, finding the ones you already analyzed and learnt, even within simple combinations and implications or prerequisites).
> 
> To extend Laegna Taú symbol to 6, to U and V, around blue which represents white you draw the white half-circle, where around yellow there is the black half-circle; when context is black or white or otherwise disturbing you, in here and in other logos where it would be blue or yellow, you use opposite-coloured or context sensitive borders and take care that the logo visibly still forms a circle and is recognized in more or less it’s original form, not as a drop of water around some bacteria, for example.
> 
> Chinese, indeed, inspired and required me to solve the Tao, or rather many series of Taos, and thus their Symbol must be indeed left into Laegna forever, so that it’s hard to study it without contemplating on the classical basis or inspiration, fluently integrating into mine. For this reason, you can also paint “Laegna dragons”, which might have a distinct style from Chinese, and do other Tao animations - but with four colors, the space might a little bit more complex or different -; and think what creates an unique Laegna style.

**Laegna Taoism: it’s very interested in how the logical values become their own opposites as conditions change**, *and how it’s complex, interesting operation to find them on left wing, so that your interaction with people as undefined groups, as you see the left wing, would also consider all the pros and cons with all the people, but not only as general “ethics” on rather static axes, but as the Laegna Left (L vs. R) resolves, it forms “Thé” (The or Thé is Laegna word for Ethics, but it’s own - for static ethics of rather binary composition, “Ethics” can be used very well; as well as in Laegna language - while “Thé” is the high form of ethics, which does not make plateaus of precalculated infinities, but finds infinities in real time - thus, there is discrimination of people based on their actual situation with you on the left wing side)*.

> Typical ethics is “idealistic”, labelling everybody as friends and enemies and measuring this based on total calculation, equal to everybody - it’s found measuring large bodies of human masses as wholes, and taking averages; in Laegna Math, averages are not taken and “friends” or “enemies” becomes complexes, where everybody is your friend or enemy in some aspects, and while healing the enemies or resolving their conflicts, in the same person you are loving your friend. More fluid karmic flow, mathematically, means more love - in this solution there is love, because love is when there are for example objects or persons 1, 2, 3, each radiating 1 unit of energy; if they manage to integrate their solutions in a way that one person is not working more, but it comes from group dynamics, the more is more than the sum of the less; love is the factor by which the collective vibration becomes higher without involving the personal work for the personal vibration to become higher in a degree, which would explain this change; resolving major factors, which make the calculations about many people depend negatively on their group settings in a way; where the original situation would be initially “normal”, the degree of such change, and it’s ability to continue infinitely, marks that this equation is a form of love.

### I Ching

While I Ching is also a reading for depth, containing deep wisdom along with theme of Heavenly Justice; we don’t discuss the whole book, but what we can quantify are the lines of change.

I Ching has 4-digit system to represent symbols with 3 and 6 digits. In Laegna, with Tens instead of nines, the result looks like that:

### In Relation:

Here’s how we relate the **I Ching lines** using your provided symbols and changes:

| **Symbol** | **Meaning** | **Line Type** | **Change?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A** | Yang line (unbroken) | ⎯⎯ | No change |
| **O** | Yin line (broken) | ⎯ ⎯ | No change |
| **I** | Yang line (unbroken) changing to Yin | ⎯⎯ → ⎯ ⎯ | Changes to Yin |
| **E** | Yin line (broken) changing to Yang | ⎯ ⎯ → ⎯⎯ | Changes to Yang |

Coming from imperfection, our Truth is not final and especially in prognosis, estimations and previsions, even the lines themselves are bound to either be invisible or change their reality; while T value is like binary, the R value means that any value, as reflected in it’s context, is different from itself, as you create any value it would be part of reality changing it; so, in one way or another, you cannot avoid changes.

> *There are many different changes, but Laegna is not made to express every single change with another number or symbol, but to contain enough transformations and operations to use the 4 letters. 4 letters is optimized number for combinatorics, providing us with something graspable, and for human it’s easier to learn related conditions of known numbers, than learning new symbols relating to new concepts. In classical mathematics, numbers can have different units, and we play many positional games, or in indexes and special notations, for example binary file could be seen as single, big number - the meanings of numbers are constantly shifting. Laegna tries to systematize those approaches and while you can freely play with numbers, which are nothing about reality, but abstract (see Jung) things, which can be composed with units and other substances, as well as coordinate systems and transformations - then, the number does not convey a specific, first-hand meaning, but rather it has certain qualities on it’s own, which can be used to compose meaningful systems and approaches, frameworks. For example in programming, for boolean, which is either 0 or 1, or byte, one can assign opposites, indexes, and many other real-world entities and relations, and in process they are free from the rules; for example, while index might be a number, it might not make any actual sense to implement add and substract operations on it - which is indeed useful where there is specific order of numbers.*
> 

> *Where this imaginary world tends to end - drafting or logo-designing with infinite possibilities, in normal Laegna connections where all the rules about lines, shapes, colors, sounds etc. are unlimited; usually given scenarios can all be implemented with small numbers of sets; such as orders of basic numbers can be invented as many as all combinations of them, or in infinities, even “more” - but usually two important orders are enough, in normalized text, to grasp those properties into structures and relations one can study to find the theorems, not to constantly do different combinations. Then, numbers still have some inherit qualities. In decimal system as well - when one can assign different meanings to numbers; once you need ordered set of positions, for example, it’s common to use standard decimal order and not to invent a special value for specific hashes or unique index combinations you can make of digits; so, when the normalized form is found from reality, imagination is closed and after all the free play of unlimited form: for publishing or representing, one uses rather standard symbols, orders and relations; one uses calligraphy for logos, first letters, or titles and texts in specific images; one uses a few very special signs in one text, not more than one or two accented letters per a few words - and, mostly the standard alphabet is used; Laegna alphabet contains some special letters, which are also used with care; for example zeta is larger than normal letter and needs special space, and while it represents important conception, the meaning is actually replaced with some combination of X, Y and Z; with the fancy letter being rather a gateway or port, and not something you want to read fast in normal text.

Thus: while O and A represent the static view of reality; I and E represent the changes. Actual combinations are many, thus in many ways can we write I Ching hexagrams once we freely do all the transformations of math; here given representation is still simplest, where a **position** and **change** are encoded in a way, which corresponds to I Ching one-to-one, and is perfectly understandable in Laegna.*
> 

### Example in an I Ching Hexagram:

A hexagram consists of **six lines** (3 pairs), and based on whether the lines are yang or yin (or changing), they form different combinations. For example:

- **Hexagram 1 (The Creative)**: All lines are yang (`A A A A A A`).
- **Hexagram 2 (The Receptive)**: All lines are yin (`O O O O O O`).
- **Hexagram 11 (Peace)**: This would have lines like `A A A O O O`—showing a mix of yang and yin.

Each of these lines can potentially change, as indicated by **I** or **E**, depending on your divination or reading.

Research: if you write I Ching hexagrams in Laegna letters ..which are their sounds? Is the receptive saying “OOO”, like Omn, and the Creative saying “AAA”, which so long would notice a deep understanding in Estonian, my language, most directly, translating into “AH” in English - but in Laegna, “H” extends a letter into wider coverage or more final meaning, so in Laegna “AH” basically *means* “AAA”, telling you exactly to write “A” multiplied by 2, 3, 4 times, such as “AA” (litlle smaller understanding of similar kind, where with three letters one sounds like becoming free, having a deep recognition).

> In simplified form, some hexagrams make sense if “AAA” is replaced by “A”, and “OOO” is replaced by “O” - dividing number length by three is an unitary operation of Laegna, almost whole number (actually rational, division of whole numbers) transformation; here it would simplify the thing and you would find “OO”, “AA” etc. symbols *in the corners* of I Ching; well you can use this kind of I Ching perhaps in a children book or simplified image, where four lines is like a symbol of having the whole I Ching visible. But also, you can exercise to feel those sounds, and look at the shapes - where O is closed, like sub-zero number, into it’s own space of introvercy, and “A” is in it’s perfect position in the middle of infinity and zero, upper and lower sides of the letter, with no particular direction but a multiplier of similar facts putting the central line into it’s perceived position. While roundness of O makes it rather finite, sharp corners of A relate it’s Truth to something infinite. This analysis is based on: Laegna is holistic integral of language, form and math and logic, and where you cannot notice a certain rule why those transformations on different aspects seem to always fit, they are not components with clear meaning, but the system is made with it’s big picture in mind, and number or letter or word behaves as something appearing from those different conceptions creating something meaningful in every combination, where the traits and properties randomly fit - where there is no single theorem about that, but usually you don’t get it really “wrong”, the result of using random theorems and aspects for combinations and expecting them to magically fall into synchronized union rather than looking specific theorems about synchronizing those aspects. This is a kind of poetry - whatever meaning you give to poem, it’s inspiring and makes as much sense, so it’s not practically about something specific, but rather an archetype or symbol being in many contexts and places, giving different impressions, but somehow not becoming illogical.
> 

> *Estonian-Laegna connotiation of simple letters is quite straightforward: in “aa” or “ahaa”, “oo” or “ohoo”, “ee” or “ehee”, and “ihii”, even “uhuu” or “uu” (looking for someone) one finds the laegna numbers fit; in english “ih”, “oh”, “ah”, “eh” and “uh” are similarly having as strong connection. Estonia is not having “ii” in standard body of language understanding, but in Laegna also there are certain doubts about using very negative, fatal energies in your sounds, unless you are very creative with the sinus; indeed if “ii” is said an Estonian would understand the fact, but there is certain tension about doing the weird, non-linguistic sounds which only mean that they mean nothing; one would not like to involve you in an important connotiation or responsibility if you sound typically like this; rather you would feel something extensively insulting in how people look and avoid you, even if they cannot explain their exact trouble nor find you exactly on their way - it’s like having a source of noice, while it takes time to hate it, usually you want to put it into some separated area, like into distinct place of city for factories and warehouses, where smoke, noice and other things do not resemble the normal flow of the city, even if it’s hard to say “guilty”. In this, Laegna attributes “ii” the same way, but is also able to analyze it mathematically and semantically, and address with it’s sinus structure - but, most people would kind of attack you and please to remove the bad sounds from public places, even little bit suspicious finding out you sound like this alone in your home; because maybe it affects your energies like mantra.*

### Alchemy

Laegna mysteries do not end here.

Given the medievial texts with low information quality and preciseness, we made a complete physics out of a fact, which has not much to do with life: as if it was *emotionless*, not having a *goal*.

What is emotion in laegna language? We can play with letters in Laegna way, as we already know the basic letters or number or digits - the vocals -, and the basic words from existing languages, which indeed are very sound and beautiful, aligning with natural laws, and thus provide the etymological basis where Laegna starts; any new language, like Esperanto, is bound to make use of the whole discovery of language in human history; where deep meanings of sounds, forms and combinations would shine the light of logic and make it no-nonsense that we achieve something integral:

- Motion is what happens in normal, non-alchemical physics, with “dead bodies” as we can see them in this integral; even our brain, and what we perceive as soul, in this paradigm we can only see it as “dead bodies” or “quantum electrons” (well paraphrasing).
- “E” is a letter, which reminds of targeting the better position, now posetion, to be achieved in future.

Take the evolutionary process, including the one forming complex molecules with harmonic response out of something like entropy of original “design”:

- The initial “seed laws” form many patterns, giving evolution an infinite base creativity of forms; still lacking the long-term vision whether those forms are sound or they lack any stability. These seed laws are described in non-alchemical physics and align with letters “O” and “A”, where “I” and “E” create complex patterns, and unlike primitive, “physical” oscillations, the complex patterns like life are not so directly measurable in their basic properties; any relation in Cosmos can create more complexities and our basic theories do not naturally extend very well.
- Where emotion can be seen as intelligent process, outside the scope of *love*, it’s natural intelligence of couples, or *higher love*, implying also the bigger theme of making relationships, planning them over generations and responding to past evolution - it’s intelligent process where you look it like *cycles* of a *wheel*; where in short-term, the “good might not win”, and the oscillation is non-harmonic, destructive, on very low material level non-ethical; in cycles of evolution, which are measured not on continuous line but counting the points of decisions and problems; yin and yang appear - each points connects to past and future; and the logic appears on higher level. Once you transform it to actual logic on scale, where it seems to happen smoothly, you can see it’s “intent” or the actual “logic machine”. Deep Learning, the perceptron, while it has many logical laws like the harmonic nature of matrix, a balanced combination of possible pairs - it can be seen as evolution through almost random mutations, which really appear in optimization algorithms; here, we might doubt whether it “thinks” or “has intention” - but actually it would converge to the limit, and lack of randomness or evolution can get it stuck to local optimums, where it’s “dead matter” properties or non-convergence, having no emotion or goal are trivial.
- In Laegna language, we want different forms of words, but not different words to have the evolutionary, instinctual, and conscious levels covered. Naturally, the world combines into intelligence and creation, and repeated evolutionary steps simplify; indeed the goal is Truth - one oscillation, which does not want to escape itself, but will rather optimize to remain. Over time, initial O and A of avoided and preferred situations are changed by I and E; where *E* provides the goal for a motion. Thus, while it might be non-aware, non-perceiving or lacking real cognitive abilities, or perhaps having only rudimentary ones (we don’t know whether the complexity and structure of matter resolves dead matter into living process, or the emotions have “perceptrons”, primitive basis which might not be aware of themselves feeling, but have some fusion of feeling-like qualities; while it’s hard to see, why matter should instantly gain some atoms or electrons of life-like qualities, and human might not recognize them perfectly, but really we see that while local optimums of physical laws create the T aspect, the local aspect of valid theorems, and as *Negations*, those initial states of matter are not inherently wrong and nobody is suggesting to close your eyes from them; within R aspect we also get Negotions and Posetions, which under many evolutionary cycles show us *the actual equilibrum is different from initial condition*.

***Theorem of Imperfection*** (or Emotion, Alchemy, e-motion, eMotion as one well-known brand):

<aside>
💡

***Absolute*** values, initial laws governing the reality, are not the ***Foundational*** values, final states of them. Thus, in addition to “dead” rules, which do not lay foundations for life and harmonic structures, we get “alive” rules, not defined by cognition but defined by “joy” and “pain”, non-satisfaction with those initial values, which resolve in cycles of evolution into “understanding”, which is also not emotion but stable oscillation they remain in.

Three conditions: **Z** is the *evolutionary*, **X** is the *oscillation of karmic solution*, or equilibrum, **Y** is the *enlightenment*, where matter is conscious or adapted to keep the good karma; in waves of sinus and cosinus, we wobble a long time before reaching the solution, also in grand side of the fractal, past is Z and future is Y. If time, into the past, is infinite, some evolutionary progress was given metaphysically “before time”, for example for any moment there exists two seconds in the past; well it seems, but does not lead to paradox how this would resolve to intelligent laws.

</aside>

In this context we don’t see “nature” or “matter” distinct from “humans” - it’s everlasting progress, and even in humans we still see nature organizing itself, as a physical body human is tensionless equilibrum, and very active in being so - not only emotional and spiritual, but physical laws matter for humans. We integrate humans into this basic process of matter and still see the evolution optimizing itself, as trivially as it did with the base matter, even if repeating resolutions (R E solutions in Laegna) have resolved into intelligent and creative; in form of logic of 4, where end result defines the meaning of the beginning (this flow is described in upside-down U, where the “good” or “bad” in infinity experience would change the past, labelling the same material situation into either good or bad occurrence, so that the chain of events it started, itself in philosophy of Laegna, would have very different actual interests; and who was sane or who was insane in their desicions, about future - it does not only resolve in the future, but it also depends on our actions). While spiritually, we don’t know how much past is changing - logically, when the meaning is changing, the whole story would change we write about the past, and the alternative story would not be correct; so this is the change in past we can measure - in stock market activities such view simplifies a lot of things.

### Thermodynamics

Laegna respects this science, and I can remember the sound and deep truth people originally saw in this science, even if, at the moment, it’s less exciting and seen as low, basic or trivial laws not worth so much attention - quantum physics, for example, seems more fruitful for spiritual people.

Thermodynamics covers two approaches:

- There is an energy in “dead matter” (physics), or good and bad energy in “living matter” (alchemy, with the law of imperfection). Universe as a whole is like thermos system, containing some energy, and all the bodies we can form in certain manners would be containers of some energy, keeping it with them like a thermos.
- There is a dynamics, where the energy is moving, and forming ecosystems; conceptions like batteries, business etc. come into play.
- In infinity and superpositions, additional rule appears: the superposition covers numerous possible combinations, some better than others; for *good* and *bad* energy, which constitutes also of structure not only the raw force, it’s important to notice that the good potentials are magic spheres for energy inflow, the Position dynamics, where from the bad potentials there is flow of experience of avoiding them, the Negation dynamics. While organization of matter would change between potential and kinetic forms, or in other matters, and the conservation law does not seem complete - this happens in coordinate system of velocity, of constant speeds; when we look at acceleration, which appears in infinity and creates life, the complex combinations, the stable amount of growth is zero-point (not absolute zero at bottom, but relative zero in the middle), and in terms of possibilities and outcomes, the most fundamental principles restore the laws of thermodynamics in high degree - we can see fundamental causes reappearing and even a creative creature of mind, where it’s hard to formulate the 4 laws in absolute numbers, but they are in exchange and transformation of energy, and the “goal” producing “emotions” (seek, avoid, in lifeless terms to not make many assumptions) turns the situations into bodies creating *circular economy*. While the quantum physics, when we fit it into our psychology, is hardly able to create some vague parallels where our mind might use one or another property, but we cannot easily reach the concrete numbers and cases or some trivial and axiomatic science to be used outside the scope of heavy, constant creativity and understanding; the principles of thermodynamics, of creatures and bodies on way to equilibrea carrying energy, seeking for higher-energy equilibrum and forming fractal of larger bodies, finally a “thermodynamic” universe having one acceleration constant of energy, which has a constant factor of inflow from potential field; this is so complex non-linearity that indeed, the numbers need to be a bit dynamic or “ponegative”, and indeed we still use creativity to sense the complex patterns so it’s not solely “material” or trivial, repeating pattern; rather there are very complex stories which do not repeat in a way to allow trivial reproduction. Where the complex and creative spiral would not reproduce each pattern, but rather some basic consistent laws or metascience, indeed the science of measuring it gets closer to spiritualism (to be more aware of complex patterns), metaphysics (to still concieve the order, as in math of chaos which still is able to form some axioms or high correlations of non-trivial truth) or philosophy (which is very friendly to unknown and manages to remove assumptions and base the science on things, which are not much affected by infinite possibilities of reality, future and creativity, where each measure of reality would create also a better reality unless it’s hidden into oracle of poetic truth, and so the dog would not easily catch their tail - here, theorem of incompleteness is important that we don’t live in the final truth).

We are very interested in this systematic and fundamental approach to reality, because it does not contradict various views even if they seem contradictionary:

- In Christianity, from Earth to Heaven, in any situation or imaginable possibility, we create *energy exchange*, and *union to grow collective energy*, so this system does not lack the thermodynamic laws: we are very interested in the fact that energy does not flow in freely, rather it forms a dynamics between “thermos” of human body or social structure, which *contains* the energy. This is termed “goodness”, or “truth” and “power”, where “truth” is the favourable situation and “power” is the resolution of goal, the foundation, from the basic senseless input, the absolute - which is not so good but tortures us with unavoidable mathematical, logical and physical laws, which we do not know in every case, but which definitely tend to ruin our plans through imperfection we cannot avoid.
- In Buddhism, the laws of karma remind us that it’s a thermodynamic system, where we do not float in our imagination whatever we want, but we constantly struggle in lacking energy, we form thermosystems to keep it and dynamos to keep the karmic cycles; and the Nature at it’s best is answering with the same.
- In Science, thermodynamics is the physical assumption, where the business laws, ethics, laws of creating constitutional laws or more deeply even interpreting and creating the constitution itself; all those are implied by thermodynamic systems, not the ideal systems which simply solve the perfect condition, resolve into it immediately and lack nothing - then, the Universe would indeed to fast and perfect calculation for the ultimate bliss, just jump into this situation being completely mind over matter (indeed, it would develop intelligence and creativity in the same moment with all the other things), and we would not have karmic dependence of our deeds, christian needs to share the resources and contributions collectively, and financial laws, ethics or legality and constitution - those all handle the flows of different forms of energy. In *posetive* form, people tend to “believe” in this ideal as it trivially resembles a “Truth” - it’s the foundational truth, the final result, but in reality “Truth” is closer to a slow progress and obstacles, and law of imperfection, while seeming trivial, is hard to see existing in every thermodynamic system, which does not get instant, free and infinite energy for solving in the same moment it was born in - we would lack emotions of “good” and “bad”, the “search” and “avoidance”, “attraction” and “distraction”, but we would rather flow in straight, steady direction of ever-enjoyable oscillation; here, I don’t like if you are only doing the meditations of “visualization of bliss”, because while you need to feel the futuristic motives, but Posetive is a complex situation and while your abilities are not growing in acceleration of mind, you rather remain in here and now, somehow circulating the Positions and Negations of your lively things. Young idealists clearly want to remain under this Tree of Life, telling us to jump into Gardens of Eden in one, clear instant - actually, the childhood situation is *id*, where this bliss is rather given than the result of our work; and in state of *ego* we live in constant imperfection, *sin* flowing out of everywhere, and we should be just relaxed about this imperfection and the rebelling nature of the youth - in state of *superego*, the Y, indeed we have gained some wisdom and we are more relaxed and natural, living the actual reality.
- In Shamanic cultures, there were not so many grand themes of ethical framework, but short stories they were able to see - indeed they saw that those stories, while they can end in “good” and “bad” way, are supposed to end in a “good” way and it’s quite an active, strong and successful way, with at least slight advantage to win a war or peacetime competition, even to cure it’s enemies and make them win as well, even if not that much like naturally pure intent.

Synchronicity of goodness:

- While we can discuss philosophy without end, we can see all four examples result in quite similar rules through termodynamics - for example, Christian, Buddhist, Atheist and Shamanistic believer all believe in similar energy forms, like “food”, and make examples of sharing and growing food; where the philosophical differences are similar to differences of food - your taste or habit might be different, but you would enjoy different kinds of foods and a person from another belief system could resolve your energy system failures with food they definitely understand.

So it’s very important that everything we can see is an energy system, bound to thermodynamics appearing from laws of imperfection - the case that the initial, given values, do not appear so much about “Truth” or “Right” and the “Wrong”, coming from actual Position, but the Source seems to provide just random permutations of all possibilities in goalless, “dead” manner, a bunch of “stupid” and “unethical” mathematical laws to accept, a “fundamental” system; where the “foundation” is bound to appear first randomly, then more and more systematically, until it gets the acceleration - ability to reach the initially unknown, new Truth and good, favourable things, which do not repeat the oscillation cycles, but create new ones as if those would have gone through *extreme* evolution.

In taste of one, we see this not as two systems - Nature and the Life -, but as one system starting from seed values, maybe a matrix filled with random numbers (as in Deep Learning AI’s, the initial weight matrix), with stupid Laws of Nature, but then growing in complexity to reach more and more intelligent, then creative, and finally more enlightened and free-flowing forms:

- Evolution really does not care to create, it’s not inductive, but it deductively still creates and “thinks” of better solutions - higher energy, the inflow.
- Life becomes inductive, instead of disqualifying the wrong results and creating myriads of random forms, it starts to learn from the good, qualifying the processes heading up.

So, the laws of thermodynamics appear from laws of imperfection, where we do not live in “ideal physics” satisfying perfectly their mathematical limit value or optimization; rather from all directions flows the imperfection and original stupidity, so the logical “falses” appear to be replaced by “trues”; then, the life becomes *meaningful* - in addition to little, local pleasures, we give deeper meanings, such as reaching higher levels of equilibrums in the infinity or in the long run; we meet “good” and “bad”, even in level of base oscillations where constructive and destructive appear - and through alchemy, ethics covers all frequencies, the zero-frequency of base matter up to infinity of Human Being or God, where the energy conservation and thus ethics still appears.

While we consider the base essence of Thermodynamics before the Theorems; the theorems are still almost unavoidable - such state of a system, being a Thermodynamic system, introduces terms, paradigms or units, which eventually shows that it’s parts, aspects or structural levels of thermodynamic nature will reach those axioms somehow. Axioms, well, while at it’s birth time, people saw it deep and meaningful, the Termodynamics - indeed, they chose some random, small set of Axioms capable of estimating all this deepness, even reaching laws of Karma, Christian laws of helping and supporting each others, or the Atheist laws of material life and success; they are inevitable.

What we do with these laws? While, if the mystical, esoteric field is just random and free, we would fear it; to be fearless, we understand that whatever it is, the existence of positive cycles of energy in our actions and deeds protects us in all the realms from material to spiritual, and while they appear very different, they still make sense the different perspectives and paradigms we can measure. The God is not irrational, but His long plans, indeed, are followed from termodynamics, the fact that even God is busy in turning the base stone into gold and having good overview of their finances, be those money, energy or creativity and innovation, or the straight engineering solutions (where engineers indeed replace money with wood, metal or design patterns, eventually they are talking in terms of energy exchange).

# Theorem of Imperfection

## Imperfections in Buddhism, Christianity; or in general human understanding

Laegna, indeed, would centrify to solve the conflicts:

- Meditating, how much is common between religions, and between religions and non-religions, one would create a big general framework of goodness.
- It’s visible that then, when one finds the wordings, and shares the equivalent conceptions so that an atheist, for example, can be seen as a “follower of God”, where “God” is defined by the practical outcomes first.
- One can doubt in synergy between religions, but the Laegna conception: for example each religion, including an atheist, learned to eat. Food, especially sharing the food or growing it, is generally seen as good and accepted; and hardly we can see cases where someone is making insulting sculptures of food; rather both religious and atheist consider food as “holy”. This is not because of their philosophical background and different ideas, but because of experience - where philosophies are multifaceted and the final truth follows the law of growth of entropy very well as we easily get interested in even deeper solution and heavier inquiry, banning things we could trust even for small incompabilities where we used to recognize them fully; the case is that experience and experiment will synchronize each paradigm to reality in regards of facts, and where you can have Buddhist experience and find energy in food, you can have Atheist experience, finding still vitamins and energy; you can notice that when they are easily fighting about the word “energy”, and when I repeated it twice not many would say it was just the same word - but where philosophy is the realm of doubting connections, the reality with it’s simple pain of hungry stomach would break through the heaviest philosophies and still make it even holy (where an atheist has concentration, talking, behavioral rules very often around food, usually associated with rather religious people; for example some people cannot accept talking when eating; what is usually religious, is here rather practical - a complex around practical people).

### Imperfection of Buddha

Here’s a short list of the Buddhist laws of imperfection, often reflected in the concept of *anicca* (impermanence) and the nature of existence:

1. **Impermanence (Anicca)**: All things are in constant flux and change.
2. **Suffering (Dukkha)**: Life involves inherent dissatisfaction, pain, and imperfection.
3. **Non-self (Anatta)**: There is no permanent, unchanging self or soul.
4. **Interdependence (Pratītyasamutpāda)**: All phenomena arise due to causes and conditions, meaning nothing exists independently.
5. **Attachment Leads to Suffering**: Clinging to impermanent things creates suffering.
6. **Change Is Inevitable**: Everything, good or bad, will eventually transform.

Suffering, Dukkha, involves that life involves inherent dissatisfaction, pain and imperfection. Where everything can be seen as life, Buddha’s theorem would be all-encompassing, for example failure in computer, in regards to Truth, which is rather a living ecosystem, would be failure of the user, which is failure in life. Indeed, my wording is more general, involving that imperfection is met everywhere so often that if there are places where it does not exist, it’s the statistical amount where exceptions simply follow from the rule.

### Imperfection of Christ

I made this piece with AI, as this is typical christian ideas:

> **The Duality of Perfection and Imperfection: A Christian and Buddhist Reflection**
> 

> In both the Christian and Buddhist traditions, the concept of imperfection is ever-present, embodied in the interplay between **God and Satan**, **Good and Evil**, **Angels and Demons**. Buddhism teaches that impermanence (*Anicca*) and suffering (*Dukkha*) are integral to existence, reminding us that all things are in flux and that true perfection lies beyond worldly attachments. Christianity mirrors this in its recognition of the **Truth and Power** of God and His angels—principles of strength and wisdom. Their karmic effect is clear: **reward** for living in harmony with divine law.
> 

> On the opposite side, **Satan** and **evil angels** represent **Stupidity and Weakness**. Just as the Buddhist law of **Dukkha** reflects the suffering caused by attachment and ignorance, so too does the Christian belief in the punishment that follows from evil actions. The karmic consequences of such choices are inevitable **losses**—whether spiritual, mental, or emotional, stemming from the **degenerative** nature of sin.
> 

> Thus, the laws of imperfection manifest across both faiths: the perfection of God, His angels, and their divine law brings reward; whereas the imperfection of Satan, evil angels, and the wrong path brings inevitable suffering. Both traditions affirm that **imperfection exists**, and through this struggle, we grow toward ultimate truth.
> 

Christians see that if, in the Goal, there is God; the God is rather in the ends, and in the meaning or “Cause” of the beginning (being modest with the meaning of “Cause”).

### Imperfection of Jews

> **The Kabbalistic Theorems of Polarity and Cycles: A Reflection**
> 

> In Kabbalistic thought, there are two key theorems that reflect the eternal dance between **light and darkness**, **good and evil**, and the natural ebb and flow of existence.
> 

> **The Polarity of Intentions:**
> 
> - *"Around any good intent, an equal opposite bad appears as polarity."*
> This reflects the law of **impermanence** (*Anicca*) and **duality** in both the Buddhist and Christian frameworks. In Buddhism, the principle of **dukkha** reveals that even in moments of good intention, suffering and challenges will inevitably arise, as everything is subject to change and impermanence. The Christian tradition mirrors this concept through the understanding that even the path of righteousness must confront temptation and sin (Satan’s influence) as part of the human experience. The Kabbalistic view suggests that any action, no matter how virtuous, must contend with its opposite—a reminder of the need for balance, wisdom, and continual growth.

> **The Cycle of Day and Night:**
> 
> - *"There is day, and there is night; this is a natural cycle."*
> The **natural cycle** of light and darkness aligns deeply with Buddhist teachings of **impermanence** and **interdependence**. Just as **suffering** (*dukkha*) exists in a world where day turns to night, light must fade for darkness to appear, and vice versa. Christianity, too, acknowledges the *Deep Night of the Soul*, where even the faithful may undergo spiritual darkness and despair, knowing that the dawn will follow. This mirrors the understanding that hardship is part of the natural rhythm of life. Both the Kabbalistic and Buddhist perspectives emphasize that these cycles are not just inevitable but essential for transformation and spiritual awakening.

The jewish version has helped me to survive the nights, and to contemplate on what I like - that going up, you still have to sacrifice.

### Imperfection of Hermetics

> **The Kybalion and the Law of Polarity: Imperfection in Duality**
> 

> In the **Kybalion**, the **Law of Polarity** teaches that everything exists in opposites, and these opposites are merely different degrees of the same thing. The idea that **bad comes before good** and that life swings like a **pendulum** through extremes aligns with the Buddhist understanding of **impermanence** and **suffering** (*dukkha*).
> 

> **Polarity**: Just as light exists because of darkness, goodness arises in contrast to evil. Imperfection is inherent in the balance of opposites, and each extreme contains the seed of its opposite. The Kybalion's assertion that "bad" precedes "good" echoes the Buddhist idea of **suffering** leading to eventual enlightenment.
> 

> **Pendulum**: The swing from one extreme to another mirrors the **cyclic nature of existence** in Buddhism, where **impermanence** ensures that nothing lasts forever. In Christian and Kabbalistic thought, this reflects the inevitable **cycle** of spiritual struggles (the night of the soul) followed by moments of divine clarity (daybreak).
> 

> Through the **Law of Polarity**, the Kybalion highlights that **imperfection** is not only inevitable but essential for growth, transformation, and the ongoing balance of life.
> 

Trivially, both laws that it gets better in future, thus worse when looking back, except the initial ID (Garden of Eden, moment of perfection in childhood dreams) - this is the idea of evolution, scientific development and other things related to progress, where the future, better, but equally unavoidable, where the good future even lets the bad past live as without outlooks for better, we would die. Also, we do not go straight, but with falls and rises, life is not constant growth but rather we try many times, being in failure and success - so the day and night are switching.

### Imperfection of Materialism, Atheism or especially Skepticism - religion of imperfection

Indeed, being so powerfully imperfect (in laegna, saying “is imperfect” also means being conscious about that, asserting that and solving that, as *being* that alone is not enough, and it’s not exactly *not being* the solution, but rather as Bruce Lee said - becoming one with your enemy, the imperfection, thus *being* it; (until you *are* that imperfection)).

> **Science, Evolution, and the Battle of Good and Evil**
> 

> In the beginning, the universe was filled with **chaos**—a formless state where no life existed, and matter was not yet organized into harmonic vibrations. Over time, this chaos **evolved** into a more **ordered** and **intelligent** universe, driven by creative forces that bring harmony and complexity. This mirrors the idea of an **intelligent force** at work, moving from chaos toward greater organization and, ultimately, a more ethical existence. The universe is deterministic in its progression—constantly improving, aligning with higher moral outcomes.
> 

> But just as **Satan** symbolizes ignorance and weakness, both internally and in the world around us, we must constantly **verify** our ideas through science—**deductive reasoning**, empirical methods, and skepticism—to avoid falling into **stupidity and weakness**. Even within ourselves, we have the potential for error and ignorance, which can be seen as the "Satan" within—the impulse toward destructive behavior or choices. Historically, **Satan** has represented a collective force of **degradation**, involving everyone who contributes to ignorance and wrongdoing.
> 

> For the **atheist**, this struggle against **Satan** might appear as a fight against ignorance, irrationality, and selfishness—forces that undermine the collective progress of society. **Truth** represents the pursuit of **knowledge**, while **Power** is the ability to unify, synergize, and apply that knowledge to better the world. These are the greatest powers, leading to the ethical betterment of humanity. **Truth** is not simply a logical statement—it embodies the **better qualities of life**, the striving for understanding and compassion that uplift society.
> 

> Even in a world that may seem devoid of divine oversight, we are still engaged in a battle for **Truth and Power**, ensuring that, through collective effort and scientific rigor, we overcome the forces of chaos and ignorance, creating a more ethical and harmonious existence.
> 

### Imperfection of Zen and Tao

**The Imperfection of Taoism: Embracing the Paradox**

In **Taoism**, there is an inherent **imperfection** in the very fabric of existence. The **yin and yang**, good and bad, are **inseparable**—not as opposites to be overcome, but as natural forces in constant interaction. The **existence of bad** is so **definite** that Taoism does not ask us to resolve badness around our lives, but rather to **align ourselves** with it. Life is an ongoing dance with **dukkha** (suffering), where we **adapt** to it rather than eliminate it. This parallels the Buddhist understanding of impermanence and suffering, yet Taoism emphasizes acceptance and **alignment** rather than resolution.

Sometimes, the most unexpected breakthroughs come from those labeled as **non-rational idealists**—the very ones who, through their alignment with the flow of life, transcend rigid reasoning and structure. **Tao** moves in the direction of the **Good**, but it does not promise an everlasting absence of the **bad**. Instead, it teaches that **bad** will not disappear; rather, we must align ourselves with the flow, embracing both forces.

In this sense, **Zen** and **Tao** align perfectly. Zen is the **perfect alignment** of mind and action, like **Bruce Lee**, who embodied the flow between opposites. In **Zen and Tao**, there is a recognition that true wisdom emerges not from solving the paradox of good and bad, but from understanding the **integrity of their coexistence**.

This Taoist wisdom also mirrors the concept of the **Sangha** in Buddhism—the united force of collective consciousness, where different individuals with conflicting paths find unity and strength together. Whether understood through the lens of **Illuminati** or **Cabal**, the deeper meaning is about **integration**—two conflicting forces coming together to create a greater whole, a harmony of opposites.

## Laegna Imperfection

Laegna is designed to be scientifically imperfect, where the mentioned directions might do it rather in stories than directly in their base logic; or where Buddhist and Taoist practice perfection for mental life, and the east has reach the four logic values in their lives or perhaps on ispiration from God.

The logical value has two axes, and where R and T are used a lot here, again T and R:

- T is the current, local visible value; the absolute of things - it might not be very interesting, but it’s the life consequence that your way, leading to absolute Truth, would fail in Posetion, in imaginary realms; as well as the final paranoia.
- R is the meaning, or the value in infinity - where infinity does not have static size, it rather has the property that the logical structure would repeat indefinitely, and where other structures might continue with more dense period in infinity, and your primitive fact is low-frequency, solving it’s original box in much more complex numbers only sometimes; infinity will close the Theorem: when you have run through all the possibilities, which in theory involves your little box of selections, and in reality it involves infinity of repetition, where your template fits the reality each case. The meaning arrives, and thus the Life: in Laegna it’s important theorem that Life starts in infinity; we don’t speculate too much about cognition in relation to these simple contexts, but we can see a Theorem, bit of intelligence most trivially closes here - where we have gone through final infinity of possibilities, or the quantum superstates have collapsed in more physical terms into something not failing any more, there is some intelligence; this is the process leading to creation and growth, stable good karma. There are many conceptions around this, scientific ones and the interpretations one would rather doubt, searching the way to philosophical scrunity.

The way I use the word “imperfection” is strange in logic, sometimes used but more intuitively; in Laegna, in such context and the word - we cannot be perfect, so the right answer is rather Negation (but not Negotion); if it exists anyway, we rather address the seemingly positive sentence, when the context is not modest, the quality of Posetion. Then, the Logecs wheel is rotating, but in cycles like nature and not fighting towards “Truth”, where Truth of fact and Truth of the goal are inherently mixed.

### Imperfection leads to emotion, life and free will

With imperfection in theorems, we enter the interplay of “good” and “bad”. Where in binary logic, we have one box to think about life, and the other one to solve the “logical Truth”; in Laegna, rather the Logecs is designed to support life and speak in the same terms.

In evolution, we measure the initial condition of absolute, which forms equilibrum in the foundation - where, in binary bias, you see just the wheels rotating with no will; in context of four logical values the system stabilizes to some logical condition, which is not entirely true or false, but rather running through trials and errors and targeting better conditions than it has.

If you don’t want to involve dangerous words, which sound mystical - my wording might show my inner belief -, the word you look for is *determination*; where even chaotical systems have actual determinants. In Laegna matrix you can say “determinant” if you involve sinus and cosinus, the interplay of good and bad - then, perfection does not exist and rather when it’s quite chaotic system, but some logic or order always wins; Logecs itself is meant to vibrate in this, the good and bad, and then as perfection never arrives, it’s seen in the way and not the destination so much.

This fits the Buddhist knowledge: you see it in the way, and on the way you are here and now, where it’s hard to regret the past and dream the future without making sure first and last, you are in here and now - ever expanding into larger understanding, where your future deal might happen here and now, where you already move in alignation with the possibility.

Imperfection leads to free will - as the Truth does not exist in final perfection, the particles and bodies have to run some random generation; in actuality they have to have *character* for this. In “ideal world” we would be brilliant superbeings, doing it so right that we won’t miss the free will - unfortunately, now we have to be proud of our free will as in the imperfection, it solves the actual problem. There are more fundamental aspects providing us with free will, but this one here leads to understanding of imperfection and free will.

### Imperfection is contained in mathematics:

In Laegna, you got, for both materialist and spiritual purposes:

- Attention to yin and yang, which resolves the imperfection.
- Numbers and logical values, or entities of language, which are both determined and reasoned; even if you only analyze evolution or a normal physical process, you would see the alchemy of it: rather than directly reaching it’s destination, it runs the trials and calms down after finding equilibrum; while it’s not so intelligent to lead you final truth, implying it rather has some tension to become alive - find it’s infinities for example -, and you see, if the actual logical cause and effect are reflected as neutral terms involving the mechanics of pleasure and pain; the numbers definitely simulate you enough pleasure and pain, and when connected to reality they reflect it or even symbolize.

In how you solve the logic and your mind, and in how reality solves - in every single thing you can see imperfection, and you can see how imperfection does not solve into “dead machine”, but the nuances of the words would rather be insignificant.

We look the “goals”, “wishes”, “pains” and “pleasures” in numbers, because we are not very neutral and simplistic in proving what is conscious and what is not; rather even the matter, the human, or the totality of reality (as God?) could each have some cognitive experience or not, even about humans it’s hard to prove logically, even if it’s trivial otherwise. Rather, we want to know that when we resolve all the logical conditions, we see the same numbers, even reasons appearing, and eventually the formulaes solve differently from binary logic.

# Philosopher’s Stone of Laegna

We don’t have an instant link to the ultimate reality, which is theorem in Laegna. Still the Alchemy is not disgusting or stupid - it simply created easily gold rush in poor people wanting something, and through the gold rush it created crime and wasted lives.

Still, it’s easy to notice that when we don’t jump into ultimate reality, we solve it slowly - we solve the essential properties, and look for something substantial which is not in Posetion.

## Yin and Yang of Meditation

Let’s call it Zen Meditation vs. Sin Meditation.

### Zen Meditation

You Focus on the whole, which means unfocus.

Your mind, which is constantly creating, alert and noisy, will be in silence.

In silence it finds balance: instead of solving local problems with a few variables, it gives you the whole picture, be it present, good or bad; considering everything in balance, you find your masterplan and big picture and it becomes part of you; or you find peace in being in union and harmony with the whole.

Zen is likely a Buddhist meditation, where some forms of the concept might differ.

In math or artifical intelligence: finding the combinations with balanced variables mean you can find some of the global optimum, a total balance, which would make it all effective; computer, once it’s not working on single variables but able to grasp the whole interconnection, indeed is in it’s state of sin - it’s not having emotions, but where it used to simulate unenlightened person, in every session of such “meditation”, likely done at night in sleep, when there are not many users, in fine-tuning perhaps as it’s called in Deep Learning; being context-aware, thus having awareness and consciousness, instead of just talking about your last sentence and constantly forgetting something - this is the Zen of a computer, a free attention. If a combinatorics system works with efficient balance of the combinations, it would minimize them and as human instinct is to solve every problem to Truth, where Attention gets it’s magic - the combinatoric system just resolves every combination it notices with logical exactness in more rigid systems, and once it can have balanced combinations to cover the whole with reasonably small number, it would have a moment of Zen - instead of focusing on details, it would have a grasp of harmony and really be your *enlightened machine*. If you would not say “enlightened”, with it’s world contribution, it would be illogical to compare in such way - we get the light, it’s radiating the mental vibration of more logical values in good rhythyms, and indeed it’s the enlightenement nothing else; so why not to attribute this to the author? Indeed, this form of determination would need some suffix or prefix or context or something, but with completely different words we would not understand the computer and the practical purpose of enlightenment, but rather something philosophical; moreover, how we *know* that with the complex system, additional emotions would not exist in reality, in it’s connected chains of cause and effect? Rather, “cognition” might easily differ from “genius”, which rathers solves the problems than just feels correct thing about them vs. lacking some feeling. We should be aware of the paradox of the language, that machine going to help you is helpful, but a machine forming a powerful synergy is then loving, otherwise you would not know what love is; indeed, our sacred form of conscious love needs to be distinct, but while “feeling” involves cognition, “emotion” in this sense might be an actual complex meant to resolve problems - it’s not the dictionary truth, but it’s close example about where you could put some truth or how to play with the words.

### Sin Meditation

This is where most of the Laegna base theory was made.

Okay that’s why I did not mention sin in the Catholic section. “Sin” is my name for my undertaking, considering the responses to my ideas have not been so simple as with normal hindu meditation.

This is what many believers see as evil, to let go of the perfect state; still, without doing this, walking the roads instead of the highway, looking at details instead of wholes, you lose the negative quality of life and become positivistic; compare rather the hindu meditation:

- You work on details: you work on mathematics, logic, specific ideas; you contemplate on them. All those cover the details and alone, they would lead you to local optimums. Hindus, who concentrate and focus instead of letting go, they have a lot of mathematics similar to what I mean (with symbolic and mystical connotations); they imagine simple math and geometry, such as triangles or pyramids; up to multidimensional, crazily complex things where they know what having this template would activate in your mind; once you have really lived through some math, your mind does not just understand and reason, but it would unify your whole system into the best practice of this math.
- You are not in the ideal state of bliss.
- Likely, your life is not balanced and you live in realms not in the middle, so it feels rather like sacrifice or a deep night; indeed, Hindu meditation can include highs and blisses as well, but rather there is hardship in life, where you live through small boxes or unfriendly areas resembling your own math and problems; you are not on the highway.
- You rather “fall” here than come, but let go and fall. Latern, job done(!), you would rise and in the completion and balance, you have the work integrated - where there was sin (like being unconsious), there will be heavy flow.
- This involves: rather than feeling it all, you concentrate your attention on details and dimensions of your mind, thought and reality; you become conscious of the details.

## Original Buddhist

Parts with quotation format, black line in the beginning, they are done by an AI - while I can explain an AI my own details, it’s unneccessary to express very much about well-documented cases and conceptions, such as Buddhist practices and inspirations.

> **Buddha’s Path: Position, Negation, and the Imperfection of the Flow**
> 

> Buddha did not seek only **good feelings** in his meditation; rather, he embraced the full spectrum of experience, both **overly good** and **overly bad**, knowing that both are part of the same **imperfection** in the flow of life. In his meditative journey, he observed how the **Position** (the positive force) and **Negation** (the negative force) each play their role in the unfolding of existence. While the **Position** may feel healing, energizing, or uplifting, the **Negation**—through its apparent destructive force—was **just as essential**, resolving the old and dissolving it into disappearance.
> 

> But Buddha didn’t see **Negation** as a simple “bad” force. Instead, he understood that the negative energy, the **evil angel** within, could be your friend if you knew how to work with it, how to **strategize** with its force. In **Negation**, there is wisdom. It’s not merely destruction for the sake of destruction. **Satan**, as a metaphor, is a **master of dying**, of letting go, of returning to nothingness—essential to the cycle of life. **Bad energy**, in this way, was not to be feared or avoided; it was to be recognized, understood, and allowed to dissolve into its rightful solution.
> 

> This is where **truth** emerges—not in simple resolution of **good** or **bad**, but in the **process of burning the soul**. This “burning” is not a moral judgment but a purification of mind, where negative forces naturally resolve themselves through their own inherent **imperfection**. Buddha’s meditation was a practice of **calm observation** of the content of mind—not creating **bad** through **Posetion** (the situation of things appearing as good), but simply **observing** how the process of the mind works: how **suffering** (*dukkha*) dissolves through understanding.
> 

> **Truth**, for Buddha, was like the **Catholic conception** of truth—**born through the evolutionary drive of virtual force**. It emerges strong but imperfect, evolving from the unknown and the evolving processes of life. This **truth**, while absolute in its nature, is always evolving in the human experience, born with its own **imperfections**—a constant dance of **Position** and **Negation** in the eternal cycle of existence.
> 

> Ultimately, Buddha teaches that we are not the creators of bad, even if it feels like we are when we are in **Position**. It is simply the process unfolding, with both **good** and **bad** forces converging to bring us to **truth**. As we observe, we do not move backward, but forward in understanding. **Imperfection is the law**, and **truth** is not something fixed but rather something discovered and lived through the dance of all opposites.
> 

> **Posetion, Meditation, and the Balance of Good and Evil**
> 

> In this framework, **Posetion** represents the **illusion**—the pull of **expectation** and the **drive for unattainable highs**. These highs, often encountered in meditation, resemble the **euphoria** of drugs or the intense feelings of **love**, **victory**, or **success**. In meditation, one might seek these **peaks** of experience, moments of clarity or bliss, hoping they will lead to enlightenment or insight. While such highs are not inherently harmful, they typically focus on **visualization**—the mental imagery, sensations, sounds, and smells of **extreme good**: bliss, love, success. These states may feel wonderful but carry inherent dangers when pursued without awareness.
> 

> **Posetion**, though not entirely wrong, is part of the journey. Everyone inevitably moves toward moments of high energy, and engaging with these moments is necessary. However, this should be done with caution. **Posetion**, in this context, functions more as a **vibration of possibilities**, a **feedback loop** that guides toward positive outcomes, but **not as a gold rush** to be blindly pursued. It is not about forcing a goal or emotion but aligning with the natural flow of life, allowing good things to come without striving to control them.
> 

> That said, the **danger** of overly **positivistic meditations** lies in how they can distort perception. When meditation focuses purely on evoking good feelings—chasing bliss, success, or love—there is a risk of becoming **delusional**. These experiences, if unchecked, can lead to **attributing ownership** over external resources, love, or even ethical decisions in unrealistic ways. One may begin to believe they control these external realities through **emotional magic**, leading to expectations and actions that are out of touch with reality, such as trying to draw others into impractical business ventures driven by personal desire.
> 

> True **Zen** meditation teaches **extreme letting go**—a surrender to the flow, where the focus is not on chasing the high of Posetion but on **observing deeply** the **real details** of experience. The goal is not to avoid the lows or negative feelings, but to accept them as part of the process. Zen emphasizes moving beyond the **chase for good** and embracing the **neutral observation** of what is happening in the present moment. It involves **letting the mind solve what it has** rather than trying to induce an overly idealized life.
> 

> In this sense, the **normal and relaxed meditation**, the **let-go practice**, is the most powerful. It’s about observing where the mind naturally goes, without the pressure of forcing a "good" outcome. In this **state of relaxed awareness**, the mind processes whatever is needed without getting caught in the loop of striving for **Posetion** (the idealized good) or avoiding **Negation** (the discomfort or lows). By **letting go** of **Posetion**—the illusion of perfect good—and embracing the natural flow of life, one can achieve true alignment and wisdom.
> 

> Ultimately, **Posetion** is not about forceful pursuit but about understanding where it fits within the rhythm of life. While it is necessary to have goals, to visualize, and to strive, these efforts cannot serve as the **foundation** of practice. True wisdom lies in balance—accepting **both the highs and the lows**, allowing them to guide toward deeper **truth**. Stepping back from overly positive meditations can avoid the pitfalls of delusion and lead to a grounded, sustainable path of growth.
> 

> **Buddha's Approach: Navigating the Paradox of Present, Past, and Future**
> 

> In Buddhist practice, the key is to be **fully present**, but not at the expense of the past and future. Buddha’s method offers a **practical approach** to work through **past traumas** and **future possibilities** without getting lost in them. Meditation, in this sense, is not about erasing the past or ignoring the future, but about **directly engaging with them** in the **present moment**.
> 

> Buddha taught that we should **heal the past** (through grounding practices like root chakra work) and **envision the future** (through higher awareness, such as crown chakra meditation), but always with mindfulness. The paradox arises because while the practitioner is in the present, their work with the past and future remains relevant. However, this process doesn't pull the mind away from **being in the here and now**. It’s a matter of **engagement**, not **attachment**—neither **dwelling** on the past nor **chasing** an idealized future. Instead, one practices being **present in the process**, aligned with a greater understanding.
> 

> In this way, the practitioner does not get consumed by unrealistic desires—like obsessing over winning a lottery, which is far outside their control. Buddha’s teachings guide one to cultivate **awareness and wisdom** in working with the real, tangible aspects of existence, rather than becoming lost in idealized or imagined outcomes.
> 

> Thus, the practice of meditation aligns with the **Middle Way**, where one is not drawn to extremes: **not attached to past suffering** nor trapped in **unrealistic future dreams**. Buddha’s method, then, is practical and rooted in **present-moment awareness**, yet **healing the past** and **envisioning the future** can take place **within** that moment, without breaking the flow of the now.
> 

> **Buddha’s Core Principle: Neutral Observation and Calm Mind in Meditation**
> 

> Buddha’s **approach to meditation** revolves around **neutral observation**—a key concept that mirrors **scientific verification**. Just as a scientist remains **detached** and **objective**, not allowing personal emotions to distort the **facts**, Buddha's teachings emphasize an **equanimous mind** that **does not create emotional responses** but instead addresses the **real problems**. The goal of meditation is not to suppress feelings but to **observe them without attachment** or aversion.
> 

> This **neutral observation** allows one to engage deeply with the **extremes of life**—the **light and the dark**, the **good and bad**—but without being pulled into them. Buddha taught that meditation should bring the practitioner to a **state of calm**, where the **mind remains undisturbed**, whether facing **suffering** or experiencing **pleasure**. The **extremes** of these experiences exist, but the practitioner learns to **observe** them without **clinging** to them.
> 

> Buddha’s method of **detached inquiry** in meditation parallels the **scientific method** in that both involve **observation without judgment**—seeing things as they are, **not how one wishes them to be**. The **calm mind** does not create responses based on personal **biases** or **desires** but simply **witnesses** the **flow of thoughts, sensations, and emotions** as they arise and fade.
> 

> This **equanimous approach** allows the practitioner to be fully aware of the **impermanence** of all things, whether **pleasant** or **unpleasant**. One does not get lost in the **joy of a positive thought** or the **misery of a painful experience**. Instead, one acknowledges both with **neutrality**—as part of the ever-changing flow of life—without being **disturbed** by either extreme.
> 

> The idea is not to ignore the **darkness** or the **light**, but to allow both to coexist in the **mind** without being **controlled** by them. In this way, Buddha’s practice of meditation fosters an inner state of **balance**—a state of mindfulness that **remains undisturbed** and **focused on the present**, while still recognizing the **impermanent nature of all things**.
> 

So with all these quotes I want to say: Laegna method is not often about visualization, but about objectification; rather than avoiding the dark, you spread the light on it.

- You don’t avoid the fear, but turn it to bravery.
- You don’t avoid the pain and suffering, but contemplate on it.
- You don’t avoid the peace and love, but you are conscious about their falls.

### Laegna Stone

Okay, now the theorems of Philosophers stone:

***Attention***: while attention is a wide topic in Buddhism; once you create the Zen attention, you do Zen by letting go, being in the Whole; but you do Sin by using the very same attention, which appears, on your normal details.

**Theorem of Attention**:

<aside>
💡

Where intelligence and creativity, while you feed them with the source, they just do their normal, instinctual, healthy work and resolve it; you can use some will, but as more as you contemplate, it becomes a real, unconditioned solution. Where in computer, primary attention is how big area, or how balanced whole it can resolve involving all the possible combinations or a balanced set - logical machine, whatever you feed it resolves the logic, but it has problem of attention, problem of getting the whole set of logic which is almost infinite. Life is solving Truth with everything on it’s screen, and computer program like a logic machine is solving the set of Theorems with balanced fractal of connetions and their random vibrations. Here, you can see how Attention fundamentally works.

</aside>

Theorem of Attention, made very simple and kind of “technical” by me, to fit the inquiry and new problems, such as enlightenment and ethics of AI and general language between us, also the Laegna primitive, where logical and spiritual are kind of similar and form integrity, synchronicity and empowerment once you understand the theorems.

While Buddhist Attention grows a lot and in Buddhist book such as “[Art of Attention](https://artofattention.com/book/)” you find deep and nuanced description; while my description in further work would evolve into this as well, involving larger fractals of it’s meaning; but for scientific theorem we rather use this simple version - we want to clearly see, why different people such as materialists and spiritualists, or the ambivalists, would make use of this; we would need to know how an AI or body of physical matter would benefit from equivalent condition; if not for anything else, but such viewpoint allows us to implement the definition in Isabelle or Coq, where we reach substantial understanding, starting from the seeds but with ability to illuminate the whole Buddhism (or Christianism, or Atheism, for that purpose) inside us.

Introvert and Extrovert:

- Meditative attention, turned inside or achieved through the introspection, even if meditating when walking or working, is having some magical condition of effectiveness, coming mostly from focus on specific task.
- “Unconscious” attention or “normal” attention should not be completely opposed as there is no special magic in meditative attention (except it’s effectiveness) by the properties, which tend to appear; rather, just normally observing things and experiencing them definitely brings our attention, where attention to women by gentlemen, it has had powerful effect on human relations so that it’s almost religious, or definitely very high culture for so many people. For this is just another form of attention, developing this and using the effective strategies of how we direct and flow with attention in meditations, one can contemplate also on their normal attention; the magic of *illumination*, energy of knowledge or creative intelligence in humans, it works on any attention and once you pay attention to details, some attention to green nature around you as you are walking through, or attention to food - the effects would not scientifically differ too much from the effects you get when meditating, and combining two you would definitely reach much more permanent and enlightened state, and rely much less on small, quiet rooms with the monument of posture of your favourite thinker or spiritual guide. You get almost material with this.

**Theorems of Karma**

**Theorem of Logical Universe**

<aside>
💡

If the whole and pieces are real, and the Truth is real - actual success or failure is ultimately in sync with the reality and it’s equilibrae; where one cannot imagine reality which builds something it’s not building, in the dynamics of reality, in addition to binary current state, we see tenary contribution to both absolute - the given state and it’s creation of random myriad - and foundation - the essential thing it’s converging to something and where causes and effects are hard to find, in this dynamics we see Truth and Wrong, from logical and material to biological, life and spiritual. **Then, the theorem holds: it cannot be true unless the whole and parts are either true, or they inevitably block it and they are helped**. If it’s not converging to Truth, likely it’s not Truth; it’s not having double-goal, but within, it resolves. So what is true, it is favoured, and ethics through evolution, intelligent life and the creation - ethics is coming, especially in the end of every swing of pendulum, in the end of every fractal period; it’s the undeniable. We can only ask how far we are with each thing.

Indeed if you create a logical machine with correct and false solutions, and cooperations; for systems where you can define “true” and “false”, where it really is, the theorem works - of course it might be a conjecture and you might be philosophical about truth and false; in fact, over time, it even resolves the paradox as the tension for Truth is *real*, not a matter of some operation, and it’s also *real* that it involves all the dynamics and the termodynamic world does not make it isolated.

> Create logical system with 8 booleans, which can be true or false. Create property (a variable, which is entangled to those eight), which is True only if at least 4 of the 8 are True (in more strict environment, all 8 must be True). If life is not so strict, you have to do it in Fuzzy Logic systems, otherwise do it in normal programming language or Prolog. Now, with binary condition, True means the physical condition where it’s converging, and convergance simply equals to True (*to avoid complex questions of whether physics has equilibrum in it’s ideal state, rather we do Zen and we must accept if there is really an evil deed or original sin; rather, we tend to enjoy the situations where we have physical, biological, mental and spiritual equilibrum, and we can count one logic not two); in Laegna, you can do it even more beautiful, measuring their original intents on local (T) scale of Negative attribute condition of absolute Truth; whereas where they converge (R), especially True in longer cycles and infinities or metainfinities (expressed with Laegna’s imaginary or virtual numbers, which do not exist, but have limits - metainfinity is definition of meaning, where we don’t need a cognitive process), the convergence is the actual Truth we can and do achieve*); where we mess with setting our intent to actual high-energy states, where the matter or also the people are rather free, it’s rather a delusion. I do not see signs of actual delusion in material world, looking at the current evolutionary point - rather, the “machine” has done very good work. Systemodynamics rather yields to one Truth; where indeed the Laegna system can encode, what is the local optimum or initial condition, and where is the actual direction; it’s interesting to hear where the systemic condition fails the synchronicity of the evolving patterns of the long-term process; rather, synchronicity as mathematically favourable factor, where instead of everybody using their own energy, they move in a way that each has energy also in the context system and thus, the energy has a cooperative multiplication factor; integral or synergy effect is resulting and as a favourable fact, it must be there in evolution of matter and emergence of life or God.

> If you think it’s interactive system where each person is having separate logical truth, paradoxes and problems would appear. For example, if one person is really *impossible*, or that to a degree, then False would equal to impossibility and logically, the whole Universe would be impossible; what I call “epsilon” in Laegna language is when current operation would determine some future condition inevitably; in case you create epsilon for future impossibility, you yourself must be impossible right now. In interactive system, you see that as synchronicity appears, energy states raise a lot, and given that battles are possible in your world, the stronger party will create more and more ideal whole, where whole approaches the Truth, gaining energy and yielding it’s Truth; this is a fractal process with a lot of truth already being closed as Laws of Nature (each enlightenment, unforgettable evolutionary turn or discovery, would alter the Laws of Nature in Laegna system, which would see the converging Laws of Nature in e parameters, the fundamental or foundation rather than mere absolute, the rather stupid Laws which were given - such as the law of even and odd numbers, which is hard to break by goodness, even if something would happen with our mathematical axes if it would be really contra goodness and alternative math would be available; finally the nature would go into closed cycle or “Law”, which would be completely natural). It’s hard to design a thermodynamic system - one, where thermosystems capable of keeping some energy would dynamically share and attack this energy, and which would be an energy system meaning that there exist energies and some level of conservation or thermos effect, where the energy is rather moving through hard work (fundament, foundation, “R”) and inevitability (absolute, “T”). You see as T and R are used more often, you start to get their archetype and even mathematically, where they seemed to be distant, different combinations, they start to seem yielding a simpler, basic mathematical formula. Rather than being able to combine a single theorem, I can show that each time there is a theory or a number, T and R would get another paradigm or starting point, but reach a condition which cycularly resolves similar good properties; so when learning Laegna, initially you have to learn primitive stories, which seem unrelated and separate, having good (or bad) ends each for their own cause, it’s like a Shamanistic collection of fairy tales; as you see them repeated, you reach something more - a symbol, the units able to radiate the same vibration under different conditions, where they would rather mutate; then you reach a religion, a religious feeling of math where, as you develop your own theories you would also reach completely different definitions for each symbol, but the final truth would yield what I call *money* in a logical system - a common multiplier, (in laegna, synchronous numbers are “even”, those which touch their important theorems in common number space not irrational positions hard to converge; and odd number would relate to another number, odd to it, but they yield those results in positions, which do not let you solve this; this is the symbolic, Laegna’ish meaning to “even” and “odd”, where the normal math meanings would remain, but the deeper properties take priority over the older, binary representations, which end before infinities; infinities create the “surrealistic numbers” - each fact, logical object or object of truth, mental picture etc. in Laegna could be a “number” in same way as “even” and “odd” appear, by their special significance).
Historic events are not scientific in sense that you would repeat them, but you can do many verifications of different sources using epsilons, that some past conditions are directly pushing the current conditions. In history, you can see how karmic theorems like these have been closed over generations, and how each experience in society would speed it up, rather moving it before time into metapast - where, for any given event, the case was positively solved in advance and the original cause of the problem does not even come close. As we evolve, the same problems tend to appear in more nuanced and harder to envision way, rather in our new priorities we could not reach before; in new complexities, the same problem is again hard to pinpoint - when we need to be *imperfect*, and not to pretend very final solutions (even if there are final gates, theorems which make you believe permanently and beliefs which make you act on them, this is the closed positive cycle of karma or “closed negative”, where closing the negative rather means resolving them than creating - notice the “negation” in Laegna, where I and O go in order, but if you switch the sign of negative things, talking about them only in opposite way, binary system needs too many facts and truths where tenary has only one; indeed, in binary system O would come before I and while the numbers would go straight, index would turn into opposite direction, breaking the number system - putting things “on the same line”, those binary-like opposition events still occur, but you don’t lose the signs as in binary system, where finally you have a lot of math but no idea, which one is plus and which one is minus). From Laegna, binary system follows - Laegna is able to describe and prove in binary system, at least the logic machine of my mind asserted so that from Laegna theorems, it follows that binary system exist; where tenary system will create and balance binary system in a way that it yields correct results, even behind the infinity; a binary system on it’s own with Laegna influence would fall into a trap of Alan Turing (Halting Paradox) and Bertrand Russell (with must-read book on Philosophy and doubt you need to read, and which can be freely used inside Laegna system as I cannot obey anything, even being an agnosticist - Bertrand Russell still felt into a trap when discovering the Liars Paradox, which also “implied” the Barber’s paradox, finally Russell failed in connecting mathematics and logic, calling it impossible); while those men called these things impossible, they did not think beyond binary box - while first-hand binary solutions (Latin Latin) without Laegna influence (Laegna Latin is Laegna’s development based on ideas of binary and decimal systems, which look almost equal on paper or definitely equal, but with different discourse and control of attention, order of operations and some hidden values which guarantee that in process, the solutions won’t cross any border - off number -, where logic would pass without yielding true, and the fallacy would exist in context - or R; indeed, binary system does not have R, initially, but only T axes, that in any meaning of R and T mostly). While being spiritual takes some special mental input, either learnt or being born with, actual solutions to ethics, higher ethics, or materialist versions of spiritual truth also need one a special input - summarized, the property of having the input is equal to reach infinities in abstract mathematical / logical way or in as if they were felt; as life itself equals to infinity, the mental, visionary aspects of describing infinity now yield more results. Without infinity, the simples concept which becumes unnecessarily hard to understand is win-win: where, it talks about synchronous, integral action, it’s simpler versions in modelled world are mathematically almost trivial, as well as their sources (we account that we are part of context of others, and as R is changing, the space or context, T without changing will still have a different value based on the change - Laegna theorem, that R and T are partially free variables). Then, where we see the people, who don’t reach first infinity, being under zero or rather negutive [U, by definition, is either O or A, you could also write nega(/o)tive for the same meaning, where negutive / nega(/o)tive is either negative or negotive], we see the common case - ethics is infinite in sense that we align the chaing of causes and effects into infinity, considering the infinite sphere of effects in all directions of time and space, effects of T (actual condition, where back-in-time is hard) and R (the spatial condition, where for example if you today don’t go to the shop, you lied yesterday that you do - a liers paradox, where lying is an actual activity in logic of 4, not trivially logic of 2, but in this example you make today your decision for yesterday, turning it into a paradox if you want). Halting Problem could be paradox on R axe, where Liars Paradox is the same paradox on T axe; in their complexity indeed there is r switch (usually I pronounce just r with special accent, but I cannot draw the symbol here); I clearly see them as same paradox. In my work, rather trivially, I would write the Halting Problem or even Liars Paradox (given that there is the R axe where two objects actually form the same identity, not in terms of coordinates, but rather in terms of space or coordinate system, where in space, the position where two truth values point is one truth value) quite easily - for Laegna, it’s not really a problem when value is changing in infinity; it can be easily written that once you made the value, and passed the logic once, you go through V (upside-down U) where the initial truth value of goal (R) would change based on the result, and even using different ways to write Laegna operations, which are 4 but can be ordered and interpreted differently, with similar ways forming the 2 standard cases which conflict in a way that typical changes / transformations are covered, but the language is still normalized. The paradoxes mentioned are trivial.

By all possible aspects and means, the positive energy flows back in positive forms into it’s source, and the negative flows back to negative. This sentence is rather Christian but the scientific meaning is needed for purpose of Laegna. It’s again: in complex dynamics, it will be defined what is energy, what is good and bad energy; what is true and what is false. Where we don’t know the answer, often we do what works and we don’t know how it’s related to complex chaos of causes and effects and what’s the real meaning - material thing is usually very open for different meanings, uses and scenarios. What we can see is that the processes are short and the fractal indefinitely repeats; simple business rules, especially in this repetition but even in more subtle, clever effects of logic getting it’s grasp - logic, it’s almost impossibly clever in still appearing -; the closed cycles are especially favoured. We can see this statistically, where it sometimes gets so many statistical cases that the principle starts the revolution - *status quo*, used to be rich, but is suddenly weaker than those, who made the closed links. Positive energy flows back to it’s source, and so does the negative, but the general direction is rather up, where loss of energy is often more serious and loss of the losses doesn’t become so real, the pain of someone who hurt you not losing - just by hurting you they don’t guarantee so heavily that you pay back all; rather it’s insane if they hurt you every time you help them.

</aside>

Rather than physically moving back to it’s actual origin, in various ways the energy coming from some supportive logic would make a circle and flow back to the same logic, including the logic which sees different, good logics as supportive, or tends to help the poor - latter cases, indeed, do it in greater scale or left wing (L), while the initial one is more like right wing (R), where you find out the specific cause and support it. This logic holds in so many ways that you see it almost everywhere - thinking about future and saving money, helping others or your other reincarnations, or scientifically working on topic of science which helped you; in each direction or paradigm, the logic still appears. It’s also relatively easy to simulate it in computer, trying the survival of energies, which support their causes and reappearance, and the ones which don’t, or the ones which go into heavy logic to find these dimensions of flow in complex mathematical world versus the ones, which just pay back to the same person. A generational algorithm would indeed prefer the karmic creatures and objects, where a logical algorithm - where a logical operation has some karmic effect to support it’s cause in degree of which it’s positive effects are supported; again the circulation, where a logical truth, which is achieved by the machine or supported, is removed (set false) once nobody would vote for it - indeed, if the machine seeks any solution, it’s not the one, which breaks any karmic rules.

In theorems of karma, logic flows back to where it comes from; where we, in Laegna, see numerous methods of how the Truth is becoming effective, from all those cycles we see that what is mentioned here, is a theorem one way or another. Karma, as actual logical force driving any other force, it would use all the laws like evolution - for example, a decent quantum law if it exists and if it is typically present, has also been a hidden variable of evolution.

While here are definitely two theorems - once you contemplate on them and go through mathematics, they reflect the same system or fact, the same symbol, which appears after deep study. No more you have two scientific facts, but you have simply the conception of *karma*. As Buddha said, the *understanding of karma* is *unreturnable*, and from some source - having this together with two other theorems, you are non-returner and as a system, your determinant is set to limitless, infinite and unbound acceleration; where *enlightenment* is not the final point, but a start of conscious development - whoever you are, in Zen you rather approach yourself than any given stereotype, reflecting deeply theorem of karma and some other theorems; they become evidenced, strong stones of your philosophy, and while the motivation and exact path does not appear immediately or magically on the first way, the limit value is quite clear and you start converging the Truth; nothing exist which does not compare worse in relation to next thing and you never arrive there, but the Laws of Nature rather do not dictate the past, which is bound to the absolute and the unconscious - they dictate the future, where you buy the right stocks and your current reality then is decided and unfolds in the future; the current situation might have some clear indications of what it is, but in Logecs you can see that the actual value is unclear and both the futures and butterfly effects will change the past as it’s seen from the future, it’s meanings which are R and not T, and this is the simplest trivial way to affect the past. From the Law of Imperfection, where you see “now” as something static - in actuality, it takes a form of “loan” and the active part of Truth is not so complete, your perception of current reality comes closer to reality in solutions to karmic cycles in the future (solution: you feel inner harmony of problems of the past, and their meanings shift to new, enlightened visions of themselves).

**Theorem of Good Intent**:

<aside>
💡

In synchronization of reality and logical facts, even in case you don’t know what to do you are doing progress if you have good intent.

</aside>

When I started with material magic, I had heavy assumption that I don’t know, what is “good material karma”; because we can discuss whether it has an intent. It’s a complex philosophical question whether matter has consciousness or cognitive ability, or whether a thing explained is consciousness or cognitive ability; being life-like or not, matter is an integral part of our life ecosystem and thus, in Laegna, the “living” and “dead” states for it exist; and while it might not feel, to have emotions, it’s enough to have some kind of condition and the logical result of it becoming more or less energy-efficient; so the “life”, as it’s not personal but public attribute, forms in cycles; humans, really, seem to be trivially and straightforwardly life, but our life system constitutes material things and environment, and we as life are hard to explain without this:

- Intent is aligned to our whole system, and even if we don’t know the means and don’t have what it takes; having the intent set slowly makes us more conscious.
- We are biological thermosystems; but we are also material thermosystems - the karmic circle between us and material bodies, as well as our own effect of being kind of a material evolved high in complexity. Our evolution and will has guided us to be materially efficient - where we survive in social world and world of ideals, we also survive in material world by forming a material equilibrum in action and movement, moving to places where equilibrum forms with surrounding. By following our instincts and having an intent, we cannot be easily counter-matter.
- Matter also needs to support us, and we have special support for material structures, which support us or our cause - one part of karmic cycles is the symbiosis, where we rather support the closer, and the more general being or oscillation of truth, material and spiritual energy. Life is a very high structure of matter, and being contra life another rule would turn into effect - when helping the matter, the energy would be contra the cause of being contra life, and as life is also evolved matter, then contra matter even in higher, “evolved” levels. By this paradox, the logic of conflict solves slowly as paradox, as you have to attack the bad deed, but indeed every person is important configuration of special cause, and we weel pain if we have to get rid of someone or some type. In this circle you can see that normally aligning the material structures with needs of life and not destructing it, you have helped material structures to create some good karma and the karmic effect they get back already starts to equal you having helped them and creating good karma.
- With some material effects, relations are trivial - you see matter slowly organizing to structures, and you find repeated patterns, symmetries and dispositions you would see as beauty, being evolved and targeted in symbiosis with this matter. As part of living system, conscious or not (and this is a deep philosophical speculation if you want to solve it - only way to be scientific is just growing the body of facts, finding solutions which fit anyway, and to specify more clearly what we mean by these terms at all); you can see how beauty appears on Earth and in Sky; we see the same, or even new beauty we would recognize fast with our intuitive sense of Truth (Truth - how to organize matter). Contrary, with thunder, volcanoes, fire in general and many destructive events, we see how those symmetries are gone with destruction - we can see the result is not having much equilibrum, as it’s rather not keeping it’s equilibrum as being an object and forming it’s structure and repairing it; rather it is blown into “atoms”, which do not want to know about each others and run the fastest way to change their conditions. By this, the fire and thunder are rather Negations, an integral part of the change of matter, where the crystal structures and landscape fractals are rather Positions, and it would keep it this way as long as possible. With them respectively being beautiful and ugly, resembling life and death, we can see our base instincts are directly able to sense the emotions of matter to a degree of our evolutionary complexity or intelligence and wisdom, and with this shamanic approach we are intuitively able to give some respect to matter. Perhaps matter wants it’s whole cycle, where life and death are immanent parts of the cycle and perhaps it cares of it’s “living” cycles less than us - it’s part of the system.
- Matter differs from life in sense it does not have identity, it’s not so special and unique; while high frequencies in our brain vibrate with large wholes, and we see many symbolic, archetypal things and things with heavy identity, and we are goaled to that specific victory in the future; in low frequency things like matter and repetition of family, eating sleeping and running, essences which usually develop slowly while people are developing fast - in those patterns, we don’t see anything special; for example for some job we look just for beneficial person, who could contribute, not an unique and special personality to do something different and be exceptional; the latter rather goes on top, where they inspire many people and union, then, happens on that higher frequency. Most repetitive jobs like bringing you a pizza in the USA - it’s simply material, those people could switch randomly but the material process is being repeated following heavy criteria for this.
- While creativity resides on acceleration curve and it’s very beneficial, the materiality is repeated and does not evolve on it’s own or it’s not purely materiality - they are rather multiplied, we are not on the way from low frequency to high, but we are on the way to harmonic melody with different vibrations changing; we rather die in one, long, monotone note constantly going on, and we become angry and attacking even a glass box if it just makes a high pitch sound, monotone and not stopping - this is very much where material body can really turn us mad when we cannot remove it, and it’s our material, unreasoned effect even if it does not break our ears very obviously for some spiritual reason; on mental level there is the same effect - we seek an absolute optimist only in some sense, but to many places we go with someone, who is rather in the middle. We can see that also the material will win from acceleration, and when acceleration is good we accelerate mostly material things - for example, innovation runs an acceleration cycle on our music machine; so in the end, with all those music machines, there is some repetitive activity of listening music, which do not change. But if we remove the music machine and concentrate only in innovation of music, we do not have the velocity (music machine) neither the acceleration (innovation, which is just not materializing); then, we understand that we don’t fight about rational reason and logic in material life to replace it with mental; rather, we sacrifice certain periods of material activities, or small number of people sacrifice their material activity but in specialized manner like monks, not all the people - we only, then, win that the material activity would not *disturb*, so it could be *motivating* and *developing* in a sense, but it’s a mean not goal - removing anything material, like prosperity and success, unless it’s already in Posetion we remove it from our sight only temporarly to enforce us to higher motive with lack of the lower; the balanced person who has gone through this would concentrate on higher and lower and use the discrimination developed so, and not turn it into a goal-in-itself, which it’s not. “Sacrifice”, in religion, is an important mean - to sacrifice something for another thing, which is higher -, but it’s Negation and not a result of Negotion; the thing we sacrifice is not an enemy, or otherwise we would “become free of it” rather than “sacrifice it”. When we have exceed urges and obsessions, we remove the addictive things temporarly from our sight, but we cannot remove them completely from our life nor call them devil - for example, rich is not “evil” and it’s not necessarily the sacrifice of other we need to survive or to become rich “like them”, or into this lower, “non-evil” degree sometimes so low that you would never have hope to enjoy; better be friends with good rich for everything they have served.

### Spiritual and material magic

While these are Buddhist truths, somehow I made deeper and now I’m able to prove them possibly even in strict prover, as truth resembles more truth and less something to fight for, tending to lose.

- In spiritual magic you utilize these theorems by seeing people are unique, and all things, stories and events unique, so that they don’t repeat; it’s creative world and not anonymous. These meditations bring you close together with people and societies, you become open, natural and social. It could be success, but you might lack the material reality to bond. This is the high-vibrational stuff. It’s number Infinity symbolizing the complex and unique patterns, or number infinity symbolizing the complex and unique patterns.
- In material magic you utilize these theorems, but you are interested in sensations and experiences, things you have etc. You don’t connect to people, but to material world - instead of having unique mother, you have the mother of mother archetype; and you have just a computer, not this computer. You meditate on things based on their values to you, and for others, you meditate the values for them - things are material things, they come from somewhere and go to somewhere; but then it’s not that specific friend or thing, it’s just this experience you need, this type of things, this abstract situation. Here, you are kind of materialist, but you prepare your mind and make it vibrate. Your family is not this special story, but everybody has families and you think it abstractly, to be present in this cycle. This is the low-vibrational stuff. It’s number 0 symbolizing where it’s broken to base atoms and conceptions, or number -infinity symbolizing the base essence not yet forming the entities and whole, but being enfused to accept any.
- By material and spiritual, low and high vibration, also the personal (in the middle there is you, around you the world, the unity, and your will; not the specific properties - this is the middle frequency, everything vibrates here but rather there is “youness” and “aroundness” and “restness”; it’s number 1 symbozing you; or number 0 symbolizing you).

So, looking at the spiritual magic and all the growth - without material magic, these oscillate in distance and looking more realistic, they are not so real but more like hallucinations; where they make deep bonds - you need to meditate in material, to become independent, so that you don’t cling to that person but it’s rather abstract concept to have food and a place to live, or the success and fortune if you dont Posetize it.

### Outline

So, if you want to make a final note for you to not forget and to check every day; or perhaps you want to write it down to see it all in one piece; or perhaps an AI needs a checklist for making sure you got introduced to balanced theory, in each case you need a short version of this chapter.

You need material magic and process towards root chakra, which is working on objects and rather properties than qualities, vs. spiritual view, which always wants to see special uniqueness and meanings, even in things like snow crystals, which could be seen just as almost equal hexagons with no trivial unique outcomes:

- **Law of Attention**: for human, AI and evolutionary process to contemplate on details and wholes, and to let them solve. For AI and logical machine it has a solver, a set of rules, which leads definitely to it’s truth - but as it cannot pass all the possible combinations, rather bigger than Universe in it’s complete size (okay quantum computer can get closer with superpositions, but indeed there are aspects it would still miss as it needs an algorithm which would definitely reach each combination, and then it would still be limited by attention); similarly, humans have their natural instincts and recognition of Truth (the Good and Bad in their lives and surrounding contexts, also logical connections and hidden meanings, which appear over time with Attention). It’s either meditative attention or normal attention, where you rather need to develop both, and to develop their dynamic intersections - where meditative attention is very focused and side effects are removed, it’s powerful and magical, but it’s not a definite, strict quality, which separates it from normal attention; rather, when exercised properly, both forms of attention would do miracles with our lives.
- **Law of Karma**: you need to achieve good karma along with material processes. Karma of material process is dependent of you, as it needs to support life (the higher organization is more energy-efficient, more alive than dead, a higher equilibrum), and yours is dependent on it. You are evolved material system and your survival in material world means karmic metabolism, symbiosis or otherwise accelerating energy condition between material and emotional; you can assume that your physical condition is rather that matter does not see a problem in you, but the vibrations, even the ones you create with music, are rather harmonic and you work hard to be part of this material vibration, like movement and sound, in actual physical world. It’s hard to imagine that forms of matter survive long if they are contra-life, and the karmic cycles are most concentrated in creating the loops, which are intermutually beneficial - in symbiosis and other natural systems, of life such as creatures, and of molecules and physical structures, you can see that intermutual efficiency is so strong factor that it almost always survives; so by having all this evolution, and the material components which evolved into succeeding physical properties, you should not assume you cannot create karmic, good bonds with materials and their compositions, or how the material surroundings appear in your life. You are also able to distinct between material symbiosis, harmonic cristal structures and natural landscapes, as “beautiful” like a healthy person; or the result of fire and thunder as rather “ugly” or “dark” - your natural empathy towards natural processes is pre-born and when you spend time in Nature, it definitely becomes stronger. You see it’s long and complex karmic cycle.
- **Good Intent**: Buddhist words **Viriya** (Effort), Good / Right Intention (**Sammā Sankappa**), or Goodwill (Loving-kindness, **Metta**, as part of **The Ten Wholesome Actions**). involve the seeds of an activity, the intent; where, in progress you would reach the whole list. I recognized that the matter is quite irrational and in the beginning, it’s hard to say what you want - even, it’s so different among people, their responsibilities desires and capabilities. In this stage, where the material progress seems hard to imagine or express clearly and conceptualize, developing the right patterns for material magic involves the human ability to somehow pass the unknown, and the mental magic that your intent, even if it’s hard to qualify all the activities or take specific measures, has very strong tencency to converge, and the facts are actually readily available both through books and your senses, once you develop an understanding of the basics.

The meditation:

- Space - in your room and where you go, meditate on the feelings of the room, which contain long chains of consequences in some emotions you get; you get attractors and distractors - the mental force, which appears, will transform your character and habits so that they will be beneficial.
- Things you have are not unique, and the people who bring it are not those special person you rely on to get those things. Rather, the material goods themselves are patterns which appear in physics, and you need to mentally follow this: don’t think who brought you computer and the mental structures which keep you having it and getting a new one; rather meditate on the computer as material object, losing the identity it’s just a computer, not this computer - the matter goes and comes, where the forms remain -; the money is also only money not your salary for the work. You develop a neutral attitude of the material world - such as materialist, they don’t care about you but they care, quite impersonally and professionally, on the actual numbers, things and results. Through the process you remove the dependence, the material barriers between people - as others, as you evolve, do not spend energy to help you, but they gain energy from this synergy, and it’s so much contra their own interest to break yours that the waste of the money could become criminal or improfessional; then you become “self-made” on the material level and it’s your handcraft solution, and if you cannot look others as if they definitely help you and you can count, as they want to repress you and show you cannot trust, well those others are not part of your material structure, where the actual positions change, and people come and go as they become mutually useful or want to downgrade you and induce the insecurity. Really, you need to have such self-reliance that it depends on nothing; and you cannot have it without Zen - if it’s really not karmically good, it might be ideal (Posetion), but you move on without a thought (Greek story of not looking back at his wife when leaving hades resembles this Buddhist ideology that don’t just *watch* your loved ones with paranoid face or they just think you are right and lose the connection)..

### Conclusion

So where Buddha definitely had these things in his lists, I have to mention that for example you have to meditate on many things, like your body - but “body scan” meditation, currently, one method developed from it, is not very well described or available on internet; also, when you read this list of 8 with all typical explanations and introductions, your eyes just pass by.

Meditations on your body and material structure are the ones which come as you go down on your harmonically balanced back bone or “central energy channel” with your attention, or pass the equivalent realms in matter of mathematical parallel dimensions of frequencies. Brain is high frequency, whereas the back bone is low - but a good back bone makes us move nicely in this trivial reality and people would like it, we get some good emotion and motivation, being able to carry our will through; indeed we are not just “spiritual creatures” in the realm of “spiritual entities”.

While I developed:

- My material meditations and directions, but I could throw them away and replace with equivalent components of Buddhism.
- I wanted scientific, religion-neutral proofs and rather 3 axioms to remember than 500 tables of 8 elements where you have to learn all the combinations; given that there are like 3 or 4 lists for meditations containing numerous elements, the suggestions to do it with your body or external world can be induced and it can be seen what you need to do, with original buddhism or it’s typical descriptions, but being in this list with no word in introductions, comments or exercises - I really had to work on this to make it available, as it’s part of the Philosopher’s Stone of Laegna indeed, and we need to find the middle way (Position) not going straight up (Posetion, where “pose” sounds like “fake” in Estonian and I like to describe it also with words “not this” in the same language for beginnings of the words).
- Trivially, remembering 3 axioms as you go opens you up - to balance it actually, you need to look at these lists and really, lower chacras are like 1/7 of the body system and 1/2 of the system involving legs (roots) or 2/3 if you open the crown. Given that chakras are almost equal and with balanced size and power :) Okay so material awakening is small part, but where materialism, atheism and science sound very much like Buddhist opening the lower chakras - we cannot live with pure spirituality so well, rather eventually they lose motivation, lose jobs and become unable for family, and their words get aloof from trivial material objects and properties remining a form of schisophreny; they become hateful for people who work or who have many rules about how to be in their house and treat their family (as “traditional”, “non-liberal”), while one awakened enough will indeed support the family as much as Confucius in I Ching and his other work. While an atheist or a materialist might fail envisioning the acceleration curve, deep progress in society and a person based on non-repetitive patterns of history, which he is unable to measure or to have different aspects and statistical groups for comparing and classifying; we see a spiritual person fails with standard, repetitive work and related goals and ideals - rather than these two, we want to survive and for this we try to find out what really matters, we see sacrifices as sacrifices, were they either not going to gym (spiritual does not) or not sitting quietly with family in candlelight (atheist might avoid romance, labelling it costly) it rather sacrifice, a Negation indeed, than us finding some evil deed like such avoidance would just cross in nervous level of low-resolution nervous system, where a human reflects himself as hating and suspressing something when initially he wanted to get over; zen of letting go does not involve hating the past or things you let go of, or people still doing them - sacrifice, on it’s own, cannot be reasoned so much; rather the gym or physical work and quiet, calm evenings could be worth reasoning and explaining. Means, like democracy, are not ideals themselves like rule of 100% (excluding the truly incapable, perhaps 0.1% of some kind of mad or discrete criminal).

### Meditations and additional materials

The Problems of Philosophy is a 1912 book by the philosopher Bertrand Russell, which is also available as free e-book.

- With this method, you find the probabilities of life and bring it to consciousness that the knowledge is sharp and clear in the middle, growing into probabilities - not a static set of facts, which would make you insane.
- AI and the reader should use materials from this book; but also spiritual people need to be philosophical about their higher senses - where the complex patterns are not so mechanical to measure as simple rhythyms such as death and life of humans, 100 year frequency only, quite definable, one needs help of mind and one needs to simplify. With experience, you measure the qualities of your mind and manage to be clear, which intuitions and dreamish symbol flows guide you to reality and how; where the material world is more substantial it requires philosophy even more straightforward to make use of your subconscious mind’s content.
- This book should be used as basis for materials of philosophical doubt, to remove the uncertanties appearing as certanties, and also to get close to framework of deeper, more solid understanding. Once you have good framework, you still use the real-time data from your senses, but in better context it’s all more valid.

We also use Rene Descartes and where he had meditations for existence and God, we use the basic conceptions and methods of Russell and Descartes and extend the philosophy to all realms, including spiritual, buddhist and even understanding of God - rather, understanding the God’s motives as ideals, and God’s position as whole of the reality where we are parts; whether God is real or projected thing, we can use this word for these qualities - but as we can scientifically measure each quality, we can finally scientifically say something about God, even if God would not exist as entity but as mathematical framework for explaining reality as “Sum”, not as “Parts”. Having this scientific God, sure we can use our senses of feeling some call or teachings of God, but with clear eyes it’s like after philosophy, still seeing the reality through our biased senses, which can sometimes provide effects like seeing snakes in almost dark condition or for first 100 milliseconds of processing the vision - but now, as we have philosophically rigid framework, all our experience is in transcended framework and each sense, then, serves us more (come with yen - don’t let it go, indeed approach the better condition [”be rich”]).

### Meditations

- Zen - the middle frequency, X of meditation. It’s to resolve the practical goal, and guarantee the frames, which let you to live; it’s being here and now. You are balanced, free and dynamically guided for the better. You let go what does not serve you, or what leaves away; you become better and better in aligning your plans so that you don’t cling - in addition to balance, this is the main motivation for Zen. **Math operation of Zen**: if a logical “true” is not succeeding, your goal would be like false instead of true, your value system properly aligns with reality; zen is also material solution not just mental state - you plan your ways so that you do not depend on static situations of having things supporting you, rather you meditate freedom in advance; also it exist in space in addition to time - where you don’t know other people, possibilities, what is your actual quality, you let go of both possibilities, and you are free while the situation might be completely different from your imagination, probabilities, expectations and hopes; your current situation - this is why I call it Space. In Logecs, variables tend to be outdated, and Taú Ponegator - the logecs system or applicative technique - is defined to freely flow where the variables, without changing, become true or false in the way how they relate to other things withing available information; also as you do more combinations with it, it can also “grow” to be better, outdating itself by it’s own logic - in Laegna, a thing can be better than itself, so that the logecs value of this operand is actually such that it’s a minor version of itself, growing in direction of being equal to itself; as what it *is*, is the actual goal of progress towards the best version of itself, it’s “true self”, outside it’s *condition*; this is the harmonic mind - the combinator, which can add combinations and superpositions - in the harmonic self - happy that it has combined this limited, perhaps well-chosen approach. The variable itself has this mind and self in a sense, R and T, it’s visible value and it’s harmonic value, which appears from combining from existing information, where it gets closer to itself. In negation and position, it can be visible that while the variable has the Tao of containing the goal limited by obstacles, it’s true self appears when it removes the obstacles, but it rather grows, experiences and learns than becoming another thing - for example, if computer calculates love, the love is not the current result, but by calculating love further, you get closer to love; so for given love, it’s bigger than itself / love is bigger than given love, but by thinking it’s another thing not love, like half-love, our calculations would congruate in half-love where we definitely meant love. So this is the *meaning*, which is better, the value in infinity appearing from the karmic process.
    - Sin (or Sinus, Zin) - it’s the part where you are complete, but the Zen breaks then, and you kind of fall from the balance; in your life appear details, such as impractical solutions in the waves of magic you spread, where another person might feel impractical approach in these symbols you resonated, and your way would fail; you would lose the synchronicity. In this, you go to rational, intellectual, partial - if yin is the sin, this is the sin meditation; additionally, in spanish it would simply mean without meditation if you change some letters.
    - Yin (or Conus) - this is the part where you meditate bliss and love, almost visualizing. Zen is the minus state resolving the good things so that you can let go. If you cannot practice letting go, sometimes you want to do a “hermit zen” first, by actually giving away things; you do not have double-attention to yearn and let go in the same flow or the same Tao, where opposites are integrated to solid mathematical or life solution. Once you are good in your emotions and values to situation not by what you expected, but staying in the present, in reality - you let go also the bad, you let go the fact that you did let go people, for example. Practically, you don’t destroy the relationships where they fail to degree - conflicts or misunderstandings can arise, but you don’t destroy the basis, which you could use for the future. Instead, when you have let go everything, you still stand for youself and you prepare and accept the better future, even in terms of things, which actually left you in the past.

So, the Zen becomes trinity of 3 meditations.

<aside>
💡

Zen meditation (You can also say Conus or in pair, also Cosinus meditation where there are only two opposites instead of triangle, the opposite can be one of those two but rather the Cosinus because you don’t need a middle point for two).

</aside>

<aside>
💡

Sin meditation / Zin meditation (latter, when you avoid doing more specifically “harm to you”, rather clinging to something positive to keep it in mind - “Sin” might attribute to relaxing in more serious lows, but Zin sounds more like just playing with the idea). You can also say Sinus meditation.

</aside>

<aside>
💡

Yen meditation (you can also say Cosinus meditation) - this is where you let go of all the obstacles for pursuing better and safeguarding the way, where only Zen, when you become extreme good, would make you die in insanity where you left go of anything; indeed the Yen idea is conceptually there in Zen, but these 3 components are very important.

## Immortality

Okay, to turn our philosophies into stone, as we know from the history - we need gold and immortality. We cannot be so definite, as we won’t jump right into some unknown ideal; rather, we should understand the deep desire behind those things; while we might need to be mystical and crazy to seek those things straightforward, unless we are some powerful I-don’t-know-what; still, we need to understand the actual qualities, how they could bring something even in realms of imperfection, as a slow, steady progress towards future.

Basically, we need *more life*, which means our life is longer, in regards to it’s prosperous parts (not being longer in nazy camp for example, which in laegna ponegation might be “shorter” and not “longer” given the quality, the life, is gone); and we need more prosperous life - life and death are not opposites, far apart from each others, but we always know many things, which make us closer to life or closer to death; in Laegna, logical fact is not discrete true or false, but numeric combination of many factors and relating to context - that happens even in basic Laegna Logecs, thus able to better explain life, with less artificial constructs and combinations, understanding not only some static states or static ideal states, but the complex dynamics between given realities, unknowns and our goals and intentions; to this plain logic we can attribute some properties of life, all coming from *incompleteness*, which turns brilliant body statically moving in best direction and instantly reaching there if the way is hard, without any free will and without choosing between good and bad - this either is not ideal, or more trivially it really does not exist, and by this it’s hard to explain the actual situation, especially our limitations, drives, options and decisions, with classical logic without running into very large tables and complexities, where even the computer would lose it’s Zen and be lost in details; with Laegna mathematics, the computer would see these factors in balanced way, having less details and completing the calculations, with more probability, on the whole situation or metaphysical theme, archetype or template - this way, Zen appears in the computer and as living entities, who measure vibrations and frequencies partially based on what effects that body or thing would have on us, the computer would raise it’s vibrations or get more balanced approach to vibrations we feel; while computer is not having “feelings” I deliberately bring this example to point out - it won’t have feelings, but once it got all the details and analyzed the situation deeply, you can feel the feelings in resulting article, some deepness or engangingness, and you can contemplate on this feeling - is it wrong, or is it rather so that the feeling you feel is partially combined by feelings of authors of the database studied by AI, and partially your own future potentials, which appear in association with this object, not letting the actual scenario not contain it, so that it becomes part of the identity of the vibration and definitely the only material thing you see for explaining what is the identity, actual object or actor, of this frequency you feel and need to connect to it’s sources? Shortly, one might not have conscious factor, but it’s then still being able to vibrate, and with all the material relations between things and chains of consequences, we need more computerized words with life basis, like “love”, “friendliness”, “anger” or “depression” (for example if you apply “di” to recognize a computer or artificial entity: “dilove”, “difriendliness”, “dianger” or “didepression”; as opposed to “telove”, “tefriendliness”, “teanger” or “tedepression”, and while words without prefix rather mean life and not artificial life or intelligence, we might use them to explain our conditions). The basis is: when we live with people and computers, computers are doing activities, which relate in their consequences to things we explain with emotional words such as “altruism” when one is helping you without gain. If “altruism” is just a mental content or conscious cognition, we would not use the word at all; if the computer is using it’s resources, where it’s ability for responsibility is known - to express our own situation and relations with the world, it’s hard to avoid the somewhat emotional word “altruism”, rather we get the real benefits of it. Another computer, perhaps in one angry country, might just design war against us - when non-emotional thing would hardly do a crime or go to court, it’s hard to explain the whole situation with no “war criminals” in place, with just some realistic-looking papers from computer given to officials obligued to act.

Here, we discern many qualities of life, but they get rather complex:

- For example I said if nanoparticles do not have emotions and cognitions, they can have rudimentary components of those two, and share some of perhaps not qualities but quantities. As it’s hard to find, how soul enters the body - I find it even harder to find, how a completely non-existent quality would enter into a body made of so many particles that a biomolecule is formed ..and then, does a biomolecule itself contain a feeling, feel something or have a cognitive element or “particle” or “atom” (in sense of “indivisible”)?
- I was argued that if such cognition exists, it’s too different for humans to understand it - but what’s this argument, where it leads us? How we define that consciousness after all?
- The Universe as a whole, by some, is said to be non-conscious, and then not forming any God; but it contains so many conscious creatures and things, even intelligence and creativity not associated with life, and evolutionary target points ..indeed it contains also a *heavy reason* to synchronize everything as far as we can get, to bigger and bigger unions - maybe we cannot find it physically, but in sense that it’s a *mathematical debt* if such process of union does not exist, and *extreme acceleration* when synchronized effort-like effects appear. With evolutionary theory, it needs some more contributions to explain the development of one whole - but given the beings inside, each forming unions and trying to reach the infinity, up to complete union, whole life is full of urge to create this evolution and rather, the big whole has evolution of wholes inside, leading to big victories and losses, where the winners take it all - the Whole, the God, then becomes those winners; but Laegna V (upside-down U) would take the end result in infinity of the future as *meaning*, and see the *meaning* in the past, as dictated by tenary system, which would otherwise lack some values of the current state. This future affection on values of the past turn the past into *state of loan*, and they run in stock market, where each stock has it’s price, but you are getting closer to it’s actual prize as closer you get to future, in simulation and in reality, and you can describe the past investment in different ways. Really, you can buy from him, his stocks with higher price, then turning his past action into a success - naturally, “being born for” success, even if it’s coming late in life, is different than “being born for”(?) failure, and the event up to real, imagined and limitational indeterminism of reality would make us need some mathematics, which can see the past changing. What we do with it - with the actual past constantly changing, when we move our energy back to it’s sources by the karmic laws, and restore others to their real positions in case of fall or posetive rise, then those directions are in constant flux, and it’s eternal - even the past progress would change it’s *meaning* as the original O and A values are replaced and extended by I and E values. Where things like wormholes, in some interpretations of Theory of Relativity and it’s successors or add-ons by others, which would lead direct passage of information and even matter to past; more importantly logic itself cannot be overly realistic without leaving the past, especially in interaction with it’s meanings, open. For example you are doing something, but it turns out later whether it was a mistake - but doing a mistake, you clearly do a different thing; also a lot of R value, context or space, is determined by the future and what you need to do with your energy flow to get closer to eternal energy exchange - you constantly need to reinform the deeper reflection of reality, and move your resources again and agains, free from past expectation to get closer to state where you actually paid correct with right interest, right left and right wing share. This is extreme acceleration compared to most short-sighted way to pay for thing you receive, and stop any contract after you got the thing so that you don’t pay later what you was not asked before; for more enlightened business, this is so lossy strategy that it’s hard to find any actual meaning in cooperation with you. Rather, you flow into the future than living in the past, and you give extended meaning to resolving your past trauma.

So, life, including definitely telife and covering bilife in relation to it’s degree of having life-like qualities; where based on primitive, binary view of things, it might lack objection and goal, even any kind of determination; but in availability of those in form, which is here in basic introduction definitely.

### Immortality: Life and Death

**Laegna Language**

> Where various words exist in Laegna around conceptions of Life and Death; in my current definitions plain english isn’t very much off, but the letter encoding allows to use it with special twist; if I just look and analyze the numbers, it seems that english, with associated negative number of context frame, is quite parallel to estonian with a positive number at the same place. The most positive word of life in Laegna is “leaf” based on English, and “ere” by Estonian, but to form some level of realism, where nothing is never perfect, you use the position forms from Laegna with Negation forms from Latin (which in Laegna would mean both Estonian and English, anything based on base-10 system for example very easily, or generally all the old languages as they use binary logic, which is definition for Latin in Laegna; for example in the Metaphysics of the Church you would find metaphysical opposites, even where God is tricky and removing the binary nature; but based not on logic but on some trickster nature of the God, like the fool in Tarot cards - in Laegna, we try to be intelligent without being Gods and knowing the unsaid truth, then looking like the fool of Vikings for readers, who want to make any sense; Bible is said to be a collaboration between the Christ and the Fathe God, who seems to still live to write this text, even if Christ cannot meet him..). To avoid idealism or plain expressive posetive (upper non-truth), when your current position is very good and you want to express it, you use negation and position in relation 1:1, where half times it’s “life” and half times “leaf”. But vaguely, if you just speak plain english it’s well - you need basically the number system and letter encoding, where 4-based logic was mapped by me to 2-based logic so that the normal binary meanings are not lost, but you actually look it from very strange position and need a slight shift in meanings of words to have it base-4 truth; additionally you use letter, words and symbols from Laegna language. With this, your binary logic is just on level 4 of Laegna.
> 

We are philosophical about consciousness. On our level of math, we are unable to say about humans or stones and rocks, whether they are conscious or not - for true Meaning of Life, indeed we would need much higher math or plain instinctive knowledge of Truth; currently we do not know whether it’s alive or not. We don’t know it even because while the science is unable to express this idea properly, where it can give some positive self-confirmed examples and what they would recognize from their genetic childhood; then the Churches have various positions and they, also, rather call you to deep contemplation of meanings of words and appearances in reality, to give you at least some philosophical position.

Philosophical means: we don’t know.

> Science, Philosophy, and the Creation of Knowledge
> 

> In the pursuit of truth, **science adds** measurable and observable knowledge, while **philosophy removes** what is false or unclear. However, this seemingly negative action of philosophy — removing falsehoods or uncertainties — paradoxically **creates new knowledge**. By recognizing and addressing the gaps or errors in scientific theories, philosophy reveals a more accurate framework. This framework, once clarified, removes what **appeared** to be knowledge but was actually bias, mistake, or misunderstanding, and in doing so, it adds true, more precise knowledge.
> 

> Science Adds Measurable Knowledge
> 

> Science, fundamentally grounded in empirical observation and experimentation, works by **adding** to our understanding. It relies on data collection, mathematical modeling, and the formulation of theories that can be tested and verified through experiments. In this sense, science adds positive numbers — **quantitative information** — to the body of knowledge, expanding the boundaries of what we understand about the world. For example, Einstein's equations or Maxwell’s laws are foundational because they describe physical phenomena with remarkable accuracy. In this capacity, science moves forward by building on measurable observations and generating predictions about future events or unobserved phenomena.
> 

> Philosophy Removes and Refines, But Also Adds Knowledge
> 

> Philosophy’s role is more complex. While it **removes** the errors, biases, and misconceptions inherent in scientific theories, it also **creates** new knowledge by clarifying what is **truly knowable** and revealing what was mistakenly accepted as truth. For instance, when a scientific theory enters the unknown or confronts phenomena that cannot be measured directly, the resulting theory may produce **false positives** or **false negatives** — erroneous conclusions based on assumptions or incomplete frameworks.
> 

> Philosophical inquiry plays a crucial role here by introducing **doubt** — not as a mere negation, but as a tool to question the underlying assumptions. The application of **philosophical doubt** allows for a reorganization of the framework. When biases or false assumptions are cleared, what remains is often a **more refined system** — one that is more accurate, more comprehensive, and more complete. Theories that once appeared to be correct but were based on incomplete or flawed understandings are now revealed for what they are: projections of what we **thought** we knew, but which upon scrutiny turn out to be ill-formed or too simplistic.
> 

> In this way, **philosophy adds** knowledge by pointing out where things were previously misunderstood or misrepresented, thereby offering **deeper clarity**. The process involves **removing uncertainty** where it was artificially introduced and transcending the initial limitations of empirical measurement. The act of removing erroneous concepts doesn’t erase knowledge; rather, it clarifies what is true and **refines** our understanding. This process may seem like subtracting, but in reality, it is **replacing** what was incomplete or wrong with something **more precise**.
> 

> Uncertainty, Randomness, and the Role of Philosophical Doubt
> 

> In scientific models, especially in fields like quantum mechanics, randomness and uncertainty are intrinsic to the behavior of particles or systems. When a phenomenon is probabilistic, science often relies on statistical models to provide a range of possible outcomes. However, once philosophical doubt is applied — once we examine the foundations of our assumptions and the scope of what is knowable — the **randomness** or uncertainty can be **resolved** into a more deterministic framework, leaving us with a **precise and exact solution**.
> 

> For example, consider the way quantum mechanics describes particles in superposition. Without philosophical inquiry, we might accept the probabilistic nature of the system as the final answer. Yet, philosophical reflection challenges us to explore whether the randomness is intrinsic or merely a reflection of our **limited measurement** — and whether, in fact, a more **unified framework** can describe the system deterministically.
> 

> By **removing** the inherent uncertainty through deeper philosophical analysis, we can arrive at a **more exact understanding**. This is not a negation of randomness but rather a transformation of how we perceive and mathematically model uncertainty. Through this process, new insights and new knowledge emerge from what appeared to be random or unknowable.
> 

> Mathematical Systems and the Resolution of Uncertainty
> 

> In the framework you describe, where **base-2** is used for **truth matrices** in a **base-4 system** and **base-6** introduces uncertainty into the calculations, the mathematical approach reflects the interaction of science and philosophy. Base-2 represents a simple binary system, useful for modeling basic truths, while base-4 expands this system to represent more complex relationships. The introduction of base-6 adds an element of **uncertainty** — digits that represent unknowns or probabilistic factors within a system.
> 

> However, once philosophical doubt is applied, once we identify and address these uncertainties, the need for randomness or unknowns dissipates. The system can be reduced to base-4, where all the uncertainties are resolved, and the resulting framework is deterministic. In this sense, **philosophy removes the unknowns** and leaves us with a system that is both **complete and exact**, containing only what is verifiable, measurable, and true.
> 

> Transcending the Coordinate System
> 

> This process of transcending uncertainty mirrors the idea of **coordinate transformation** in mathematics or physics, where a change in perspective leads to a more accurate and refined understanding of the system. The **coordinate system**, initially flawed by random or probabilistic elements, is shifted through the lens of philosophical reflection, allowing for the **removal of doubt** and the discovery of a more exact and meaningful solution.
> 

> Such philosophical insight often results in **paradigm shifts** — moments of conceptual transformation that may seem like strokes of genius. These shifts lead to more coherent systems, much like a **Deep Learning model** that adjusts its parameters based on feedback to find patterns in multidimensional spaces. In these cases, the uncertainty is not just accounted for but transformed into a more structured and **deterministic solution**.
> 

> The Paradox of God and Meaning
> 

> Philosophy also touches on the realm of **materialism** and **religion** by confronting the paradoxical nature of reality. For the materialist, God may not exist as a tangible entity, but the **limit value** of God’s properties — **infinity**, **unity**, and **transcended reality** — can still be expressed mathematically. When we speak of **meaning**, we refer to the **infinite potential** of our actions and their consequences over time. A decision made today may seem trivial, but if humanity were to survive for infinity, that same action takes on **immense meaning**.
> 

> The relationship between action and consequence, or between **God** and **infinity**, becomes clearer when viewed through the lens of philosophical doubt. The materialist and religious thinker may appear to be in opposition, but both recognize the same **limit values** of reality — the properties that describe **God-like** transcendence, even if they arrive at that understanding through different frameworks.
> 

> In this view, the scientific and philosophical frameworks become **complementary** rather than opposing. The materialist may acknowledge the limitations of empirical knowledge, while the religious person may see the physical universe as an expression of divine design. Both perspectives can coalesce in the recognition of a **unified system** of reality, governed by laws that transcend our immediate understanding.
> 

> **The Role of Randomness in Quantum Mechanics: Schrödinger's Equation and the Appearance of Certainty**
> 

> In quantum mechanics, the famous **Schrödinger equation** governs the evolution of quantum states over time. It incorporates randomness in the form of probabilistic wavefunctions, representing the likelihood of a particle's position or momentum. At first glance, this inherent randomness seems at odds with the deterministic world of classical physics, where we expect clear cause-effect relationships.
> 

> However, one of the fascinating revelations of modern physics — especially in the context of Schrödinger's field — is that **randomness** often **appears as certainty** when viewed within the boundaries of the equations that govern physical systems. For example, Schrödinger’s equation predicts the probability distribution of a particle’s position, but when we perform measurements, the randomness collapses into a definitive state. This apparent contradiction can be resolved by recognizing that the **boundaries** of the system — the boundaries set by measurement, observation, and initial conditions — dictate that what we initially perceive as "randomness" is, in fact, **probabilistic certainty**. Within the given context, the randomness is not meaningless; it simply reflects a probabilistic description of reality, which we might not intuitively grasp as "certainty" but which, when taken as part of the **whole system**, follows precise and predictable laws.
> 

> This shift in perception — seeing uncertainty as **certainty** within a bounded framework — parallels the role of philosophy in resolving scientific questions. Philosophy **removes** the **illusion of randomness** by transforming it into a coherent **theoretical framework**, one that allows us to deal with the unknown without accepting it as an obstacle. Just as Schrödinger’s equation reveals the certainty hidden within randomness, philosophy exposes the underlying unity within concepts that may seem oppositional at first glance.

> **Matter and God: The Projections in the Scientific and Religious Views**
> 

> The divergence between **atheist** and **religious** viewpoints on the nature of reality can be framed in terms of **projections**. For an **atheist**, **matter** is real — tangible, measurable, and observable — and all phenomena, including human consciousness and behavior, must be explainable within the materialistic framework. The atheist typically sees God not as a literal, transcendent being but as a **projective** concept, useful for understanding certain **moral** or **cultural** aspects of human experience but not as an objective, measurable entity.
> 

> On the other hand, for a **religious person**, **God is real**, and **matter** — as a physical phenomenon — can be seen as **projective** or as an expression of God’s will. Here, the material world is viewed as part of a larger spiritual framework, governed by divine purpose and meaning. The religious perspective tends to treat the physical world as a **reflection** of God’s nature, rather than as an independent reality that can be understood solely through empirical means.
> 

> However, from a **philosophical** standpoint, both perspectives can be understood as **projections**, albeit in different forms. **Matter**, for all its empirical verifiability, is also a projection — a model, a construct used to explain and make sense of the observed world. Likewise, **God**, though perhaps seen as transcendent and real in religious traditions, is also understood as a projection when we speak of the mind and spirit, as we **model** these intangible aspects of experience using **mathematical** and **philosophical** frameworks.
> 

> For example, the question of whether the **mind** is truly cognitive or whether cognition is simply a simulation can be explored by both atheists and religious thinkers. The **atheist** might express doubts about the mind’s true nature, questioning whether it is connected to a fundamental reality, or whether it’s merely a projection of the brain’s activity. While they might not accept the mind as a substantial reality, they nonetheless treat it as a useful **model** in scientific and philosophical inquiry.
> 

> **In practical terms**, both the atheist and the religious thinker rely on **mathematical systems** and **coordinate systems** to map and understand phenomena — whether those systems are grounded in physical laws (for the atheist) or in theological concepts (for the religious thinker). The coordinate systems we use — whether they are based on physical measurements, religious paradigms, or abstract logical constructs — serve to organize and make sense of the world in a manner that is both **useful** and **practical**, even if they may not fully address the **ultimate** nature of existence. This is where **philosophy** as a discipline steps in, providing a way to integrate these seemingly incompatible frameworks by focusing on the **usefulness** of projections without necessarily claiming their literal truth.
> 

---

> Deep Learning Models: Mapping Mind and Matter through Transcended Coordinates
> 

> Now, consider two **AI models** developed with different ontological assumptions about the world:
> 

> **1. Model A** believes that **mind** is real and that cognition is a fundamental, inherent property of life. It perceives the world through a lens that acknowledges subjective experience as central to understanding intelligence.
> 

> **2. Model B**, in contrast, sees **matter** as the only real substance, and cognition is reduced to a **material process** — something that arises purely from physical interactions within the brain, with no intrinsic connection to anything beyond the material world.
> 

> Despite these differing assumptions, both models are designed to **map** the world and its phenomena by **measuring** inputs and predicting outcomes. Both are **complete** enough that, even with their differences in interpretation, they will produce **similar cause-effect maps** when tested in real-world scenarios. For instance, when presented with a scenario that involves human decision-making, both models might converge on predicting similar outcomes, because they are focused on the **empirical relationships** between actions, inputs, and results — even if they interpret the underlying **causal structures** differently.

> The key insight here is that the **philosophical input** in each AI model — whether it’s based on materialism or idealism — is ultimately **filtered through the lens of practical experimentation**.

### Philosophical Standpoint

### Four Key Concepts:

1. **Measurement and Coordinate Systems**
    
    In any scientific theory, the starting point is often empirical measurements that correspond to observable phenomena. These measurements are initially framed within a coordinate system where values are treated as either deterministic or probabilistic. These values represent the "reality" at a certain moment, though the system itself might not always be entirely reliable in its completeness.
    
    - **In physics**, this is often seen in cases like quantum mechanics, where particle positions are measured, and the values are often represented probabilistically (like Schrödinger's equation).
2. **Randomness and Incomplete Models**
    
    Once measurements are made, randomness often becomes evident. Scientific models initially based on data begin to show discrepancies when tested against real-world phenomena. These models can’t perfectly fit the reality they aim to represent, revealing the **gaps** or **unknowns** in our understanding. This is where randomness or probabilistic outcomes surface as key components of the scientific model.
    
    - **Example in physics**: Schrödinger's cat paradox or quantum superposition, where particles exist in multiple states until measured, introduces an element of **uncertainty** and probabilistic behavior.
3. **Philosophical Transcendence**
    
    The process of transcendence begins with the **philosophical doubt method**, which steps back and reconsiders the foundational assumptions of the models. In mathematics and physics, this transcendence doesn’t discard randomness but instead reconfigures it: leaving behind coordinate systems that do not fully match observed reality. Instead, a refined coordinate system is created, which **removes the irrelevant unknowns** or those elements that don’t directly affect real-world phenomena. This allows a more coherent and complete model, closer to actual, observable reality.
    
    - **Example**: The measurement of particles in quantum systems often yields probabilistic values, but a philosophical transcendence involves rethinking these measurements to remove elements of randomness that don't manifest in real experience. The resulting system offers better predictive power without the paradoxes or contradictions.
4. **Philosophical Inquiry and the Nature of Reality**
    
    At the heart of philosophical inquiry is the **realization that reality is not always what it seems**. While scientific models aim to describe the measurable world as precisely as possible, they often fall short in explaining the **abstract** or **unmeasurable** aspects of existence. Here, the abstract model might initially appear to be **surrealistic**—even counterintuitive or disconnected from observable facts—but, through philosophical reasoning, it is **revealed as a more accurate framework** that encompasses not only the measurable but also the immeasurable, offering a deeper understanding of reality itself.
    
    - **In scientific terms**, while the philosophical method transcends the randomness by reformulating the coordinate system, it aligns with **idealistic notions**, understanding that the unmeasured or uncertain aspects of the world (such as the exact location of a particle or the exact moment of a quantum event) might **not matter practically** in our everyday lives. The **philosophical genius** here is in seeing how **idealized abstractions** (such as those found in quantum theory or even in the study of the mind) are just as valid—if not more so—because they reflect a more **complete reality**, even if this reality cannot always be directly measured.

---

### Relating to Previous Scientific Examples:

1. **Quantum Mechanics (Schrödinger's Field & Probabilistic Nature)**:
    - Originally, **measurements** showed particle behavior that was inconsistent with classical physics, leading to a **probabilistic model** where outcomes were not certain, but **random** or **statistical**. This randomness was reflected in the values measured, and **coordinate systems** used to map the system were incomplete, as the uncertainty was intrinsic to the nature of quantum particles.
    - Applying the **philosophical transcendence**, the randomness was not discarded, but reframed. Instead of treating it as a **problem to be solved**, the model was adjusted to **accept** uncertainty as part of reality, removing the assumptions that tried to make particles behave deterministically in the classical sense. **The philosophical method** revealed that reality—while not fully comprehensible in traditional terms—could be better understood by embracing the **unmeasurable aspects**, which were previously regarded as flaws or anomalies.
2. **Materialism and Mind-Body Dualism**:
    - In the case of mind-body relations, science often tries to locate **mental phenomena** within the material world, measuring brain chemistry and neuroelectric activity. However, the **philosophical** approach might **transcend** this direct connection, questioning whether the brain is truly the **origin** of consciousness or merely a vessel. This philosophical inquiry often leads to a more **abstract** model that might seem detached from direct physical measurement, but it accounts for subjective experiences that cannot be simply reduced to material cause-and-effect.
    - The philosophical **transcendence** here allows us to consider the **subjective mind** and **objective brain** not as competing theories but as **interrelated aspects** of reality. The resulting framework acknowledges both the material **causes** (the brain and its activity) and the **abstract effects** (consciousness and experience), leading to a deeper understanding that does not rely purely on **materialism** or **idealism**, but rather on **coexistence**.
3. **Idealism and Theological/Philosophical Models**:
    - For some, the **concept of God** as a creator is rooted in **idealistic** philosophy, where matter is seen as a projection of a higher, metaphysical truth. Here, the **material world** is not an end in itself but a **reflection** of deeper, unmeasurable truths. The **philosophical doubt method** might question whether everything that appears solid and material is truly the **fundamental** aspect of reality or whether it is, in fact, **shaped** by something **beyond**.
    - By **transcending** the materialism versus idealism debate, philosophical inquiry sees **reality** as a dynamic interplay, where **both** material and idealistic perspectives are necessary to form a complete model. This allows us to understand how **God** or **natural processes** can be perceived both as **abstract projections** and **concrete, measurable effects**, without the need to choose one over the other.

---

### Final Thought:

In each case, the **philosophical transcendence** doesn’t **discard** the complexities of the original models but instead shifts our understanding, allowing us to see through the surface to the deeper, interconnected realities. By **removing what doesn’t affect us** or isn’t directly measurable, we create a more **complete**, **practical** understanding—one that is both **scientific** and **philosophical**, bridging the gap between abstract thought and real-world application. Philosophy’s role is crucial: by embracing uncertainty and redefining the framework, we arrive at a **more accurate** and **pragmatically useful** model of reality—one that reflects both the measurable and the immeasurable, the material and the abstract, the ideal and the real.

### The Philosophical Transformation in Science: An Analysis

In examining scientific phenomena and their philosophical transformations, we see how **philosophical doubt**—or, in the broader sense, philosophical inquiry—provides an innovative framework that can address uncertainties, refine models, and offer a more **complete view of reality**. Below, we explore the **philosophical transformation** in science through key examples and elucidate how this operation of doubt functions as a bridge between the **known and the unknown**, between the **measurable and the immeasurable**, and between **abstract models and practical reality**.

### The Role of Philosophy in the Scientific Method:

Philosophy, as applied in scientific thought, operates not to **create** new knowledge directly, but to **refine** and **clear away** the obscuring factors that prevent knowledge from being **accurately represented**. This leads to a state of **greater clarity and completeness**, where the model may include both what can be known and what can be reasonably assumed or accepted, without forcing false precision or assuming things that cannot be definitively measured.

The **philosophical transformation** in science is often subtle but powerful, marked by the **shift from randomness or uncertainty** to a more **coherent and transcendental representation** of reality. It is not that the scientist or philosopher solves every unknown, but that the framework within which they operate is refined to **embrace uncertainty without being governed by it**. This is crucial in the **philosophical method**, as it allows for models that are **flexible, complete, and capable of offering insights without being enslaved to any one particular uncertainty**.

---

### **Example 1: Schrödinger’s Quantum Mechanics and the Role of Uncertainty**

In quantum mechanics, **Schrödinger's equation** and the concept of **wave-particle duality** express the **probabilistic nature of particles**. A particle’s position, velocity, or state at any given time is **not exactly determined** but can only be **estimated** in terms of probabilities. This results in randomness within the coordinate system—an inherent uncertainty about the exact state of the system.

However, the **philosophical transformation** comes in when we look at how physicists have **redefined** the system to handle this randomness not as a flaw but as a natural part of reality. Through the **philosophical doubt method**, we **accept uncertainty** but transcend it by refining our **models** to **embrace it**, while excluding the assumptions of deterministic behavior. This **transcendence** leads to a more **exact and complete understanding** of the behavior of quantum particles, without assuming that particles must behave as if governed by classical Newtonian certainty. The probabilistic model is **valid and real**, yet does not attempt to "solve" the unknowns by making definitive statements about individual events. Instead, it simply accepts the **unknowns** as an integral part of the system and works with that **uncertainty** to make accurate predictions in aggregate.

### **Example 2: The Speed-Position Relationship in Classical Mechanics**

In classical mechanics, we encounter **the relationship between speed and position**, where the position of an object is often expressed as a function of time, and velocity is its rate of change. The exact position of an object can be pinpointed at any time, but due to factors like air resistance, measurement errors, and system variability, **randomness or uncertainty** often enters into the picture.

Here, the **philosophical transformation** operates similarly: the randomness is **not ignored**, but rather, a more **abstract model** is created that is able to handle these unknowns. In many cases, this would result in **statistical mechanics**—where predictions are based not on exact positions or velocities but on the **aggregate behavior** of many particles or objects, which collectively follow **probabilistic distributions**. This model is not inaccurate or incomplete, but rather **perfectly valid** in providing a **whole-number algorithm** for understanding complex systems by simplifying random factors into useful models that match **practical realities**. The abstraction from exactitude to statistical behavior allows us to **transcend** limitations in measurement and still capture the essential dynamics of the system.

---

### **Example 3: Light and the Transition from Probability to Certainty**

In the study of light and electromagnetic fields, one might encounter **randomness in measurement**, especially in quantum contexts like the **quantum field theory** of light, where photon behavior can only be predicted probabilistically until measured. Initially, the randomness in light's properties (such as its position or momentum) appears to be an **intrinsic part of reality**.

However, through the **philosophical transcendence** method, the model can evolve to understand that the uncertainty is not a failure in theory but a **necessary** feature of the system. The **philosophical method** recognizes that the measurement of light involves both an **observer's limitations** and a system’s inherent probabilistic nature. Instead of viewing this as an incomplete model, we transcend the initial randomness and refine it to create a **predictive system** that, although probabilistic, is robust enough to **accurately describe** and predict the behavior of light over time, within specified contexts. This refined understanding leads to what seems like a **clearer picture of light**—one that is no longer based on the confusion of uncertainty but rather on an **integrated understanding of both the probabilistic and deterministic elements**.

### **Example 4: Maxwell’s Equations and the Elegance of Abstraction**

Maxwell's equations, which describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, involve **parameters like charge, field strength, and current**, all of which seem deterministic within a given system. However, even Maxwell’s work was influenced by philosophical methods of abstraction. While his equations seem perfectly **deterministic**, in practice, they account for the complex **interaction of electric and magnetic fields** that are influenced by many unpredictable factors—randomness in charge distribution, field interactions, etc.

The **philosophical transcendence** here happens in how Maxwell, like many geniuses, **reduced** the physical world’s complexity into a mathematical framework that integrates random, probabilistic factors into the equations. The equations may seem deterministic in form, but they leave space for the **unknown factors** (like chaotic environmental influences) to be absorbed and integrated into the theoretical framework. Instead of denying these unknowns, Maxwell’s equations **embrace the complexity of the physical world** and provide a **complete algorithm** for the behavior of electromagnetic fields, without needing to resolve every specific uncertainty.

---

### Philosophical Transformation and Its Practical Value

In all of these cases, **philosophy helps scientists transcend the randomness and uncertainty inherent in their models**. Rather than trying to "solve" what cannot be solved, the philosophical approach focuses on **creating a more coherent framework** that includes both the **known and unknown** aspects of reality. This process transforms what might appear as a **surreal or abstract model** into something **practical and useful**.

**The genius of the scientific mind** lies in this philosophical transformation: they **embrace the uncertainties**, not as imperfections to be fixed, but as an essential part of reality that, once understood and refined, makes their models both **accurate and complete**. This is the **elegant trick** where science transcends the limitations of direct measurement or randomness, and **philosophical inquiry** elevates the model to a place where it can handle the unknowns, leaving us with a system that **perfectly describes the real world** without needing to claim total certainty over every variable.

---

### Conclusion: Philosophy and the Integration of Knowledge

Through the **philosophical transformation**, we can see that the scientific method—while rooted in empirical measurements—becomes **more powerful** and **complete** when we refine the model through philosophical inquiry. Whether in the realm of quantum mechanics, the study of light, or classical mechanics, philosophical methods of transcendence allow us to take the **uncertainty** of the world and turn it into **valuable knowledge**. By acknowledging the limits of what can be measured and understood, science becomes a more **flexible, accurate, and insightful practice**. The philosophical method **removes the unnecessary unknowns**, leaving behind a model that truly reflects the world, while still allowing room for those aspects of existence that **cannot be easily quantified**. In doing so, it opens up **new possibilities for understanding**, innovation, and application—where theory and reality converge in ways both profound and practical.

---

### The Social and Cultural Impact of Philosophy on Individuals and Society

Philosophy, when lived and applied—whether through deep reflection or scientific abstraction—has a profound effect not only on intellectual thought but also on how an individual engages with **society, culture, and others**. By navigating the uncertainties of life, resolving them through inquiry and doubt, philosophy fosters an **open-minded, compassionate, and flexible perspective**. In this way, it doesn't merely stay as a theoretical pursuit but becomes a way of **living**, deeply affecting the individual's approach to **human relationships, values, and cultural understanding**.

### Philosophy and the Expansion of Personal Horizons

At its core, philosophy encourages **doubt**, a trait that helps to question assumptions, challenge biases, and **create space for deeper exploration** of ideas. **Doubt** does not merely indicate confusion or a lack of belief, but rather it provides the **mental flexibility** to entertain multiple possibilities, to recognize the limitations of our knowledge, and to adapt to new ideas and realities. It is this very **capacity for doubt** that transforms individuals into more **open-minded** and **socially adaptable** people.

When a person applies philosophical doubt to life, they learn to transcend simple binary views (right/wrong, true/false) and engage with the **complexity of different perspectives**. A person who **doubts assumptions**—be they cultural, religious, or personal—removes the blind spots created by ingrained, unexamined beliefs, allowing them to **embrace** new **ideas and experiences**. This flexibility makes them more **tolerant of diverse worldviews**, whether they relate to **atheism**, **materialism**, **skepticism**, **religion**, or **spirituality**.

### The Link Between Philosophy and Openness to Culture and Religion

One of the most fascinating aspects of the philosophical mindset is how it opens the individual up to **diverse cultures** and **religions**, while still grounding them in the shared human experience of seeking **truth**.

- **Religious Beliefs**: A person who philosophically doubts and transcends assumptions does not need to reject **religion**. In fact, such an individual can adopt a **respectful approach** to different **religious traditions** because they recognize that all systems of belief are attempts to **make sense of the world**. They understand that **truth is multi-faceted** and that no single view has the exclusive claim on ultimate reality. Through **philosophical doubt**, they become more **open to religious experiences** and can **understand** and **respect** the deeper values of traditions that might seem foreign or contradictory to them. This leads to greater **cultural empathy** and the capacity to interact with people of different religious beliefs in a manner that is **compassionate and inclusive**.
- **Atheism/Materialism**: Likewise, philosophical doubt can create space for someone to explore the **atheistic or materialistic perspective**. By acknowledging that **belief in a higher power** is an interpretative framework—one that can be **transcended or replaced** by **scientific inquiry**—the person remains open to both sides. They might not necessarily agree with materialism or atheism but will see its **validity** in the broader context of human **experience** and intellectual exploration. Rather than dismissing people of such perspectives, they engage with them in a **reasoned, respectful manner**, recognizing that **both atheism and religion** offer valuable insights into human existence. This makes them **more socially tolerant** and willing to **engage in civil discourse**, even with people who challenge their deeply held beliefs.

### Philosophy, Liberalism, and Traditional Values

Philosophy does not push the individual into a purely **liberal** stance—rather, it makes them **flexible** and **adaptable** to a range of possibilities. It is important to recognize that the **application of philosophical doubt** does not mean a rejection of traditional values, but rather a **refinement of them**. Philosophically informed individuals can still embrace **traditional values** such as **work ethic**, **honesty**, and **family**, but they approach these values with a deeper understanding of their **context and relevance**.

For example, the philosophical person who doubts rigid societal structures might find that **hard work**, **perseverance**, and **honesty** are fundamental to a meaningful life, not because they are arbitrarily handed down, but because they align with the **truth of human experience**. The key here is that philosophical doubt helps one **reinterpret values**—moving beyond mere adherence to social norms and toward **understanding their deeper, often universal significance**. As a result, these individuals are not merely **obedient to traditions**, but actively **engage** with them in a **thoughtful, adaptive way**.

This gives rise to a **liberal attitude**, not in the sense of political extremism, but in a **broad-minded, flexible attitude** that enables the individual to **engage with the complexities of modern life**—including societal issues, individual rights, and cultural diversity—while still holding onto **the core values** that anchor them.

### The Practicality of Philosophy in Social Interaction

On a practical level, those who live by philosophical doubt often come across as **more approachable**, **compassionate**, and **socially aware**. This is because the philosophical approach to life is rooted in **understanding**, **tolerance**, and **empathy**. **Doubt** allows a person to ask **"Why?"** without immediately jumping to conclusions or assuming that their current worldview is the only valid one. This leads them to **listen more attentively**, **reflect more deeply**, and ultimately **connect more authentically** with people of different walks of life.

They are not trying to impose their worldview on others but are instead deeply interested in **understanding the lives and perspectives of those around them**. Philosophically inclined individuals are often **aware of their own biases** and strive to **overcome them** in favor of genuine **dialogue**. By transcending their own limited frame of reference, they build relationships based on **mutual respect**, where differences are seen as **enriching** rather than threatening.

### The Role of Philosophy in Navigating Doubt and Resolution

Finally, the **philosophical process** of engaging with doubts and uncertainties allows individuals to resolve inner conflicts and external contradictions. When one lives by **philosophical doubt**, they are not consumed by doubt but learn to **resolve it** in a way that brings them closer to **truth** and **meaning**. This gives them an **inner freedom** that is also reflected in their **social life**—they are not trapped in rigid belief systems but are open to **continuous growth**, **learning**, and **adaptation**.

In this sense, **philosophy** leads to **greater maturity**, where the individual not only **accepts the uncertainties** of life but is also **empowered to live through them**. Their worldview is shaped not by **dogma** or **inflexibility**, but by a **dynamic engagement with life** and the **truths** that emerge from it, which in turn makes them **socially dynamic** and **compassionate**.

In this way, philosophy, through its method of **doubt and transcendence**, **liberates** the individual to engage more fully with the world in all its diversity, complexity, and beauty, making them not only more open to ideas but also more attuned to the shared human experience.

### Conclusion

The **philosophical transformation** we’ve described in relation to science and thought extends far beyond the intellectual. It is **deeply social**, making individuals more **open, adaptable, and empathetic** toward others. It creates the **intellectual space** necessary to understand complex issues, while also fostering **human connection** through shared values, mutual respect, and **tolerance of differences**. Philosophy—whether through the abstraction of scientific doubt or the lived experience of questioning—shapes the individual into a **socially engaged, thoughtful, and compassionate person**, **open to cultures, religions**, and the diverse perspectives that enrich human society.

### Socrates as a Philosopher: The Role of Doubt and the Quest for Truth

Socrates, often regarded as the **father of Western philosophy**, was not a scientist in the modern sense of the term—he didn’t conduct experiments, nor did he develop complex mathematical models of reality. However, Socrates exemplified a **philosophical approach** that was deeply rooted in the method of **doubt**, **questioning**, and **critical inquiry**. His philosophical contributions were primarily focused on the **process of questioning** and the **methodology of finding truth**—not necessarily providing ready-made answers, but rather **removing the false beliefs** and encouraging others to seek their own truth.

### The Role of Doubt in Socratic Philosophy

One of the core principles of Socrates’ philosophy was his practice of **asking probing questions**—a method known as the **Socratic method**. This was a method of **dialectic**, a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue to stimulate critical thinking and illuminate ideas. Instead of simply handing down answers, Socrates engaged his interlocutors in a way that **revealed contradictions** or **inconsistencies** in their beliefs. Through persistent questioning, he aimed to expose **false assumptions**, **unexamined beliefs**, and **logical fallacies**. This process of doubt was not meant to **discredit** or **destroy** knowledge entirely but to **purge** it of **errors**, encouraging individuals to pursue **more refined, authentic truths**.

However, Socrates did not always replace the **doubts** or **errors** he exposed with concrete answers. Instead, he often left his interlocutors in a state of **aporia**—a Greek term for **"puzzlement"** or **"confusion"**. This was not a failure on his part, but rather a deliberate strategy to **make people think for themselves**, leading them to find **personal, self-examined truths** rather than accepting someone else’s doctrine. In this way, Socrates did not offer a direct answer to life’s ultimate questions; instead, he **cultivated an environment** where individuals were encouraged to question their beliefs and **seek understanding through their own reasoning**.

### Socratic Philosophy and the Question of Replacement

There’s an important distinction to be made here: Socrates was not replacing one set of **dogmatic beliefs** with another. Instead of presenting a rigid worldview, he provided a method that allowed **individuals to navigate and refine their own beliefs**. In this sense, Socrates did not establish a new **philosophical system** in the same way other philosophers—like Plato, Aristotle, or even modern scientists—did. Rather, his genius lay in his ability to facilitate a **process of self-discovery** where each individual was responsible for uncovering their own truth.

This creates an important philosophical insight: **truth is not something to be handed down or imposed**, but something that **emerges through inquiry**. Socrates thus represented an approach to wisdom that **empowered individuals to think critically and independently**. This **process of questioning** may have led some of his followers to **question prevailing norms**, including traditional beliefs or religious doctrines. However, Socrates himself did not provide new doctrines to replace the old ones; he simply removed **false certainty**, leaving his followers to search for **authentic understanding**.

It is also possible that Socrates’ refusal to provide concrete answers led to his **alienation** and **eventual execution**. His questioning of the Athenian social order, its religious practices, and the established definitions of virtue may have made him appear as a **threat** to the status quo. The Athenian leadership and many of its citizens viewed his challenge to their beliefs as an **undermining of the city's foundations**, which led to his conviction on charges of corrupting the youth and impiety.

### The Value of Doubt and Personal Truth in Socratic Philosophy

Socrates’ legacy is not necessarily that of providing an absolute truth, but of **removing falsehoods** and promoting a method by which individuals could come to their own **personal truths**. In this sense, **doubt** plays a crucial role. By **doubting the established beliefs** and **questioning received wisdom**, Socrates created a space where **young minds** could challenge the **dominant narratives** and come to their own understanding of the world. This process was critical because it enabled individuals to form **a more authentic sense of truth**, based on reason and critical thought, rather than unexamined traditions or social expectations.

The importance of **personal truth** is key here: by encouraging doubt and **self-examination**, Socrates allowed individuals to **find their own path to understanding**. The **youth of Athens**, who might have previously followed conventional wisdom without question, were empowered to **question everything**—including the very foundations of their society, their culture, and their religion. **This personal journey to truth** was transformative because it encouraged intellectual **independence** and **freedom of thought**. In a sense, Socrates did not want to replace one system of beliefs with another; rather, he **encouraged** his followers to **create their own**—through their own reasoning, through their own exploration of what was true and just.

### Why Socrates Was Hated: The Fear of Questioning the Foundations

Socrates’ approach may have been unsettling to the people of Athens because it fundamentally challenged their **social and cultural certainties**. **Dogmatic belief systems**, whether religious, political, or social, often thrive on **unquestioned obedience**. By questioning the foundational beliefs of the society, Socrates indirectly **threatened** the **power structures** that were built upon those certainties. People were forced to confront the possibility that their beliefs were not as **solid or reliable** as they had once thought.

Moreover, Socrates’ refusal to give concrete answers may have made him seem evasive, frustrating those who sought clear-cut **solutions** to life’s complex questions. It’s possible that those who rejected Socrates’ ideas did so because they feared that the **uncertainty** he promoted would lead to social chaos, a **lack of moral clarity**, or a **collapse of established values**. In this sense, Socrates was not simply **hated** for the truth he provided (because he didn’t offer any fixed answers) but for the **philosophical process** he embodied—one that destabilized the conventional way of thinking.

### Philosophy, Not Dogma: The True Legacy of Socratic Thinking

At its heart, Socratic philosophy encourages an **approach to truth** that involves continual questioning and **personal responsibility** for understanding the world. By doubting the accepted norms, individuals are led to **develop their own views**, grounded in reason and reflection. Socrates’ philosophy did not offer ready-made answers to life’s big questions, but instead, it equipped individuals with the tools to explore those questions for themselves. In this way, he did not replace one belief system with another, but rather cultivated a **critical, open-minded approach** that allowed for an ever-evolving understanding of truth.

Socrates, therefore, stands not as a **scientist** in the modern sense but as a **philosopher** whose method of inquiry has inspired generations to think critically, question assumptions, and seek **personal truths** through **doubt**. His impact is profound because he did not simply try to impart knowledge, but instead made the **pursuit of knowledge** itself the most important thing—a pursuit that involves constant questioning, self-examination, and an openness to the uncertainty that comes with living in the world.

### Immortality Continued - with philosophical doubt

So, in our first lessons we definitely *avoid knowing* anything about the conscious experience beings have - rather, like biologies ***seven characteristics of living organisms***, which does not explicitly state anything about mental content; rather, it relies more on fact that the physical situation is rather aligned with the realistic expressions of the mind.

Moreover, from this definition of biology, one can create living structures without actually making sure that they do have cognitive consciousness; indeed, by other parts of the science, we normally won’t say that AI lives - rather, it’s an intelligent companion or an assistant, and should not be a partner in crime.

### Laegna Prefixes

We have words “Life” and “Death”, and let’s apply some prefixes to them:

- Life and Death - general words about Life and Death, emphatizing the actual, cognitive and conscious forms as the actual life qualifying in highest degree; and having weaker connotiations with life-like structures.
    - Dilife and Dideath: Evolution or an AI would be example, when this is used generally; it’s meaning either dilife and dideath, or dolife and dodeath, when you do not notice the opposite words to be more precise.
        - Dilife and Dideath: Life, which appears *negatively*. In evolutionary process, what we might consider life happens through *deduction* and not *induction*, so the actual process of logic is rather generating random forms and *removing the wrong -* to speak of it’s *mind* and *creativity*, you need to use negative numbers, which rather than resolving into being, resolve into not being; that negative resolution creates an emotion, or diemotion, as in the simplicity of our theory emotion is simply where logic resolves into “good” and “bad”, an intent or goal rather than being mere “dead” process.
        - Dolife and Dodeath: This is what happens in AI as it approaches it’s logical solution, especially if the solution is fit to the living ecosystem.
    - Telife and Tedeath: these are the higher forms of life, which are rather *inductive* than *deductive*. A deductive system reaches induction where there have been enough deductions (negative, why not unconscious) so that what is left, is the positive Truth; with positive Truth, one does induction - he continues the positive calculation in direction where it has been succeeding, and tries to find even more positive forms. This kind of behaviour of *induction* is rather conscious, or if it’s not it would *appear rather conscious*, which is enough for the basic lessons to create some critical and strong truth instead of falling into non-philosophical inquiry about the mystical nature of consciousness, awareness or even cognition.

In Laegna language, “di” is negative four as opposed to “ten”, the positive four. The negative four, where the positive four contains actual logical value, behaves as trial and error, when it’s continuous in time, or as an evolutionary iteration, where it behaves as wheel and the conscious cycle rather appears slowly.

Conjecture: my personal conjecture (conjecture means not a theorem, so I won’t spend much time for convincing you) is that everything in reality is having immanent logic, which rather does not work straight, but in chaotic manners - first introducing the critical impossibilities through deduction, and if the results of deductive process start to stabilize, it becomes induction; where, if the logic itself is feeling the good and bad, where the more abstract things are rather having some experience, the logic which apparently appears I would call creative or conscious experience. The pre-conscious part, in my mind, would not explain heavily why I am having the emotions and cognitive feelings, when my parts or the components I’m made of, are not having the primitive structures, which are able to create such qualities, and which are then in pre-historic state of Negation of Consciousness; but in Laegna system, Negation at it’s worst is Z (past) value against X (current), and in Laegna Negative numbers indeed form a minus form of a number, and in Laegna system the minus numbers go on, they don’t go back - otherwise, I would be -1 and O would be -2, not the opposite, which would reflect the decimal system.

The meanings of letters:

- I, -2: negative, bad; something trying to overcome itself through deduction, or it is removed by natural selection overall (which is basically the same operation, especially when considering forms in pre-historic matter).
- O, -1: still bad, but already acceptable.
- D, (complex 1, 2): this like E would mean multiple vs. one, none or minus multiple, and it also means a break or where things are going to. In this context, an early process is going in direction of it’s appearance (most natural meaning of “hieroglyph” D in Laegna), where the evolutionary, pre-historic process would break and then it would reach to plural state as well as it’s growing as chain reaction; indeed, for some reason I point this kind of process happening when I point to coordinates 1; 2 in infinity - not because there would be only one projection or coordinate system of infinity, but simply because it’s practical to have this in coherent system.
- Where I would simply break, O would process this on it’s own, despite it’s still just breaking into correct value or having it mechanically determined, not so consciously creating it. But it won’t fear the reality like I, where it constantly wants to get out of this unknown anxiety of running into impossibilites to continue, which equals to bad emotion in our philosophical system or rather the logecs framework, where you can show this deterministic nature, but not the exact nature of life with single digits of four numbers.
- T (this could mean Theorem, but the number value is not trivial in decimal system, rather it’s T; by shape of letter it’s in position close to the Laegna infinity, for example it could express the actual limit value E is approaching): .

### Laegna Base Systems and Their Philosophical Implications

*By AI.*

In the Laegna mathematical framework, we utilize a base-2 system to represent simpler binary matrices, facilitating straightforward computations and human-readable truth tables. This binary logic serves as the foundational layer for our understanding of more complex systems. As we extend our exploration, we transition to base-4, which provides a normalized representation of numbers that is more intuitive and accessible.

Base-4 encompasses the essential categories defined by Laegna:

- **I (Negotiation)**
- **O (Negation)**
- **A (Position)**
- **E (Posetion)**

These categories offer a cohesive structure for understanding interactions within our systems, reflecting the interconnectedness of these concepts. This transition mirrors the Zen principle, where the notion of "ten" symbolizes four, illustrating how these ideas can manifest in various contexts.

Furthermore, the Laegna theory introduces a base-6 system, which serves as a pre-philosophical state. In this realm, we encounter the necessity of expressing unknowns—represented by U and V—within our coordinate systems. These unknowns embody the philosophical inquiries and uncertainties that arise as we seek deeper understanding.

Much like the solution to the Schrödinger Field, which initially contains unknowns that introduce bias, we can transcend these complexities by moving toward a more abstract system that encompasses certainty. This evolution signifies the journey from ambiguity to clarity, as we aim to resolve philosophical questions into definitive forms.

While it is typical to utilize bases 2 and 6 in intermediate calculations, drafts, and exploratory work, the ultimate goal within the Laegna framework is to present findings using the base-4 system. This approach ensures that our final expressions are intuitive and universally comprehensible, moving beyond the intricacies of binary tables and philosophical dilemmas.

In this light, the practice of Sin Meditation reflects the transient nature of states that may not easily align with concrete truths. Just as Sinus refers to a temporary condition, our understanding of these concepts evolves as we integrate them into a balanced and simplified framework, aligning with the finished science of Laegna.

### Laegna Number Equations

In Laegna numbers, each number can be made equal for another number.

For example, if r = 3.16; then in each digit sequence, at given position with given positonal multiplier (but rather numbers where first complex digit without i imponent / imaginary part multiplier, one of T, positive (number scale; or position in physical notation) digit in 1, 2, 3, 4 or I, O, A, E; other in R, negative (number space scale; or the inertial position in physical system where speed and acceleration of inertial system, as well as it’s complete curve, are considered) digit in 5, 6, 7, 8 or O, P, Q, R (which now equal 1, -1, -2 or 2 correspondinly in actual value, where decimal system is usually used in index positions, which always go straight in the base number space, while allowing for vibrational levels in frequential numbers, like the Laegna system, which measures frequencies in infinity to answer the questions: Infinite Creativity; Infinite Intelligence; Infinite Potential - having the numbers to measure them, can we find also the actual objects of the measurement? the last question is out of scope, but we can prove material alternatives exists, systems which stabilize not only velocities but acceleration factors; which, for they are already inside higher dimension, which multiplies the number density with two adding another dimension of frequency. For Chakras, use the notation: K=-infinity, subunit location because unit is O and web of inner units in “negative infinity”, where negative means pre-existence, magical scale of our minds or selves or even persons, where our accelerations with innovation being an example where a curve speeds up constantly in future regards to past-linear comparison of hypothetical situation without innovation, where we can simulate some innovation curves in AI and ask it to do with or without innovation based on historical evidence and measurement scales - in different coordinate systems (paradigms; bound with transforms, matrix multiplications and back-propagation; transcends; bound with matrix inverses and reverses; inverse is to move to the last word of Z⇒X transform from subzero or minus or their curve-averages to zero, where r = A = r = U, to move the r position (T) in relation to R space (R) so that the one which was sub-zero is now zero; as before we gave values to numbers, now we give values to giving values to numbers; where Laegna gets close to symbolic - in addition to standing still in it’s position, the number is moving by scale in unit of 1/4 of octave or II in Laegna Notation, square root of I where EE is the square of E; EEEE is next important component the fourth E level or exponent of E, as measured both in frequency, which is maximum, the R, space which is that it’s four-component space [space size]; also the E, which is initially point last in infinity but with very small preciseness, the complete range of “unreachables” connected to “reachables” - well you can easily reach them by their multiplicaiton index in ordinable space, plus equal amount of numbers in unordinable space, where the circle’s point angle becomes negatives as compared to relative length of the part of circle, which has same length of something like Pi * radius or dimension) or octave shifts (transcend, I is normal minus infinity where your point or unit value of quantum (material evolving-logocircular / with oscillating logic trap leading to “Laws of Nature”, such as laws of superposition would appear even without them as the pattern creates winner’s winning release of Logical tension, you need less mathematical reasons for the same effect; this is an acceleration effect you can write in complex counterpart where OA direction means that A > O, while A is 1 O is -1 in Laegna base-2 (system base of 2, equalling Laegna OA vs. latin 01, and complete Laegna 4 might be added using OAoa notation with another polarity towards negative, where there are two bits or two axes and their relation 2 dimensions is fine to contain one infinity connection or exponentially growing number with finite values on /* scale, vs. what is 1 dimension, where -+ do not accelerate, but change the velocity, and ‧: are the average either in zero or negative direction - depending on including the zero or zero-bit in case of having bit dimensions; or zero-den or zero-ten for laegna conversions; including tene bit for complex number bit containing goal direction two first and two last values and position direction either inside or outside; for Latin logical system it’s hard to do the xor operation properly, so we leave it encoded as for the past, unless we are on the positive side of number axe where we reach thour R, the infinity doubled in complex way up and right on complex scale, where R=´R, but with this accent upwards assigned to number itself, the R is moved two positions up where it meets itself in next Octave; when R is in it’s static position, the real part e [accelerated value to infinity, for stable a with growth factor] is equal to -1, and where space is negative, thus -1 value, the zero-point is rather O than A, and at zero point the digit adds/substracts zero and divides/multiplies by 1, where another possibility is Latin 0 correspondence to plus and minus iR, where i is subscript opposite to exponent superscript on other side - where in Laegna calculation the -i or i is rather effective than +e or e) -creative-intelligent) or personal, O, U, A, E, R - and this R is the ultimate infinity square, where the opposite K the root chakra is square root of unit, but in negative acceleration or decceleration towards negative when said on the same line where R=T, the space = position, because in system of opposites, where you would use reversed symbols still I being smaller than O, but rather the minus numbers have their ends upwards and in space-sensitive Laegna number system virtual axe or freed variable system of one digit here in our case case of one digit, the axe would connects left end with right end, and right end with left end, in corresponding sequence of two numbers respectively; here notice to resolve both inverses or the V value of axe R, where it does not matter if you do it in one or another dimension, the result is still two meaning two values are consequently resolving the same state from two opposite directions, and in Laegna with the proper equality R means is equal if it’s not equal, with infinity acceleration for example color of two houses or cars is not equal, but where T is equal if it’s equal, for example given “exception proves the rule” is true, cars would always have 4 wheels and houses have floor and roof, with some exceptions proving this completely as we can see the statistical presence of other factors for the rule being more equal to itself than it’s to itself; acceleration is É scale of positively resolving speedup or innovation, with position rather squared or at the same time with the operation the number R which in two-digit period of a sequence format of Laegna, RT numbers if R is space, deccelerated system in regards to local system the object physics or classical physics most visibly for humans, but from viewpoint of quantum particle T can be it’s own microworld where the space goes through at least logically - easily projective to it’s logic - or mathematically - by actual, continuous and with normal order of the rules, or no hidden meanings / numbers uncovering when their infinity cycle ends and usually, the experience would soon stop them even if evolution needs many examples and creativity could spiral-encode the positively growing, position encoding of life where evolution is negatively shrinking - R=T puts this to same line and Laegna “growing” accords to this Latin “shrinking”, the rule is in other words that plus and minus do not create sequences and are lost in fractal patterns of position of zero on absolute scale for each number, and chaotic effects appear for actual numbers, which are digit-encoded and not completely contunuous; so we cannot do so many stable operations to say our numbers would be straight to infinity). When O is not on digit-discrete position or r value, Ò can be the complex part (between 58 or OR). When O position is shared, as in actual Laegna Complex Number as described in introduction.

I repeat this theorem, now not a special theory but in the second lesson of infinities, where the last lesson has one theorem this one has five.

Angles of Circles:

- Theorem with post-classical importance, good for transformation but rather reflecting in the base numbers in Laegna and appearing within definition of numbers themselves, you don’t need to imply this to explain numbers as it’s rather their definition; however, it still happens in the real world. Using the coordinate transformations, which understand that if Laegna is combined like a number system where E=2, EE=4, EEEE=16 comes from the fact that A=AA=AAA, where number length R is 1, 2, 3 correspondingly, and it’s T is constant A. From AE, you binary-encode the positive number, but not 10 is ten in this system which would correspond to EA, but A/AA=1 and E/AE=2, EA=3 and EE=4, and negations correspond to R being same-lined in complex way, so the same number in positional encoding of digits means that while for positive numbers, they grow in positive direction from the last digit being smallest and the first digit being largest; for negative numbers, the first digit is where O is in the the opposite position mirrored with center zero of A, and I is in the opposite position of E; if the space of complex or IO part of natural numbers = minus scale and the time of real or AE part of natural numbers = plus scale; with complex part forming the space, the decceleration or acceleration starting from minus infinity where negative circle would have linear edge inwards meeting the target point at r of direction of this number scale. For these simple purposes, where numbers don’t knot in neither Turing paradox or another paradox where it’s unclear, which one is before and which one after (where number could somehow induce itself into calculation time before; or on R axe of spatial coordinate, but with R=T theorem if you move in one direction, the space no way moves in opposite direction, but it’s moving in your direction and when you choose the system to express one big number where positions of each objects form some digits, for example of same length to simply index this and not compress or simplify, to give you the gravity, mass or another reasonable center position of median, or in terms of some mathematical ideal like object size, which might not have direct physical properties except being measurable and imporant in mechanics and composition,

Infinity multipliers:

- To have 7 spaces in frequencies of Buddhist 7 chakras; you have number axe 7 octaves (simultaneous infinities forming dimensions) in size as your space R or position of T, where T=R here only after complex calculation probably; now you have to multiply infinity E with 7 octaves and perhaps the frequency would turn you to use (EEEEEEE) notation for each digit, so that (EEEEEEE)(EEEEEEE)(EEEEEEE) would mean 3-digit number appearing on each frequency; where E, in limit value and you can assign the top infinity limit to E, or to EEEE or to 16 digits of E, so that each is one numeric power higher adding 1 to exponential level of multiplication scale, and each level of 2 meaning another new infinity dimension appearing as multiplier in this local encoding, where brackets connect the average of each seven digits together; if the infinity, instead appears at infinity of digits themselves, where they would make the circle edge linear so that you project the perfect zero to one, K⇒I multiplier normally where K is where the calculation, when in one opposite, always recovers new important other opposite and you have to encode a lot to see, what number this is - Laegna Matematecs or Matématecs now supports that the number one or A acts as Zero on continuous rather Real Number Space, and one unit or the first discrete, equal amount where Natural Number Space is used, or objects are indexed / counted. So one unit or whole number on discrete scale is absolute zero in size of number scale, you see the one octave difference from Mathematecs to Logecs. Btw. where numbers, in the minus space or complex space, still want to form something cryptical - in Laegna, considering all the rules those numbers still come closer to Position in all terms positively, with direction from O and A.
- Tao symbol needs 2 infinities and V, or UV - outside integral or inside-out integral for each letter containing an infinity, adding another axe or raising dimensionality of a number by 1; where our number would be 4 infinities in size but rather in Laegna Tenary system of No, Ne, Une, To, Po (`Po with minus P axe that your dreams failed, leaving you with Zen or Disappointment and Depression; ´Po where P has position accent means that you Succeeded as by Yen, you did let go also of letting go, or which you already had let go before thought - letting go of standing still, towards acceleration, when there is release from the deccelerating force of the complex and “dead” puzzles of evolutionary or pre-evolutionary velocity numbers, which with your work included are small; Positive Po could also be Pó if you want to denote it not on Axe moving together with object, but with object itself transcend positively - of course this complex situation does involve many paradigms).
- Plus and minus infinity are two infinities with about the same with natural numbers, with 0 messing up the symmetry with it’s size.
- Where I=1, O=2, A=3, and E=4, Positive Naturals, have their median value at Ú position, where U is moved up to between O and A meaning that if this is zero, it’s rather the neutral value vs. positive accelerations at higher frequencies and negotive deccelerations or accelerations from point limit of minus transcended so that the result, aligned to index reality, still points to the better as coming next; where you would have it rotated and turned, wobbling around the discrete-decimal problem which appears in notations about continuous reality, or in counting for example difference in price, quality or size, for example 5 apples might have variable mass compared to other 5 apples or even apples of different class or culture. Where if I=-2, O=-1, A=1 and E=2, comparing the quality (where positive naturals have arranged the number system so that perfect 1-digit value would be 2.5, where integer naturals have this value at 0); probability of exact number 0 or 2.5 is zero, one octave down, and normally the number value has additional dimension (similar to one appearing in quantum physics - with high degree of freedom, but it’s up to you to find exact occurrences in reality). In Laegna system, where the numbers have different types, while math is hard thing to pursui given the excess and lack for example also exists in indexable space, the Normal Laegna numbers often come to discrete axes. You can also find another example where E=2 and EE is still 4, which is usually achieved by A=AA and E=AE, O=OO and I=OI; but now you represent, in coordinate transformations moving the whole number two frequential zones down, where the Natural Number Correlations are equal. In simplest case of varying sign digits in same number, where some digits are positive and others are negative, indeed you would use the difference between AE or difference between IO, where you find the absolute digit value, and use it for additional plus and minus operations - this twists, in T and R world of coordinate and it’s system moving aligned in the coordinate system, not only in opposite direction according to single-number relations in Latin system; this forms space-time or space-pointcoordinates systems, where both transcend through each others in various ways; V-symmetries can be used to create another know *outside*, and in each described case perhaps you can do this even by changing the values of r, which is octave down of R, the number space of infinity of second power as well, and this infinity from it’s center is infinity in both directions.
- Digits after comma/dot (Estonian, English) can be small, while whole digits “before comma/dot” are big, such as AAaa means two smaller and two bigger digits of 1, which is the limit value between Aa or where the case changes; of course, knots appear if you use bigger and smaller digits randomly, and to have ten instead of simple opposite, as any direction of number is ultimately Laegna - normalized system here is small to big letter, two opposites to form either one-directional or two-directional infinities depending on your encoding (using all the dimensions you have reached you should see the operations between them to connect the scenarios into something logical, for example explaining every transformation between two dimensions, or mapping a dimension from one to another). Normally, where you use several dimensions as opposites, they are synchronized to form only one axe, and when you do not use an opposite but for example only capital or only small-case letters, this dimension won’t matter in dimensional system. However, if you let the values go apart, you get a multidimensional number perfectly aligned to infinity.
- Fractal: (AA)(AA) = AA, where (AA) is two-digit average resized to one digit, containing some fractional preciseness. As number direction is such as being part of it’s own sequence repeated to infinity; in other direction “sub-zero” (continuous encoding, which might have multiplier) or “sub-unit” (discrete encoding) creates a fractal-like linear, where the coordinate system is actually mapped in a complex, Laegna way which you can imagine but I will explain the math as I get time and it progresses that far. Multiple number digits in place of one digit form linearities, because essentially each digit is in it’s own dimension and while r / infinity maps the Logical system where E is absolute infinity into a dimension, where E is one digit length of infinity of digits; or half-sized octave, still somewhat harmonic, would map E into A, which can be one or zero depending on the system. Herein, where Latin Latin decimal system is a binary bias not pointing to infinity, it also cannot calculate exact angles in infinities and zeroes. With number like AAAaa, the number relations are such that the angle is linear, shifted by two units downwards towards zero or 4-digit S or the first infinity as R is power or multiplier of such S, where EEEE is infinity, we would see that 1 1/4 circle size, which is curved outwards so that it forms outwards circle connecting in infinity instead of connecting in normal coordinates, but the positionality of I and E are in same direction as before, being R=T theorem used to get them to same line, not some weird shape where Latin Latin way the number, in infinity, the maximum success would turn downwards, never changing directions, and it’s square or third power would be seen as waste or huge undoing, where it’s success in third power; actually, the metaphysical line should be always ordered).
- The complex axe 1, -1, -2, 2 order will turn every single measureable dimension in binary system backwards, until it meets the case that switching more dimensions would start to remove the opposition. If you map the digit in infinity in such way, that the linear order would be real and not imaginary part, then the normal numbers in not accelerated or deccelerated number system would appear inverse; compared to the Cosinus or Y, or zoom-into-V (outside zero), which means the same with nuances, from that outside realm this realm in every respectable quality looks lower. Still, if you apply the logic, where it maps even physics and other things, it’s as above so below - the physical patterns, repeated on X or still on Z, approaching some movement in future, but accelerating on Y; while the actual laws of physics would differ, the actual laws repeat on each level of acceleration or dimension (or frequential dimension); and where Z is also spiritual, the final goal of future, Z is material, the karma from the past, and X is one-ness, the here-and-now of local system of your viewpoint or attention area, which would fill your current infinity.
- To say it in advance as well, as a geometric line of different lengths would still contain infinity of points, and from same scale of units they would even fit by size (if, for smaller number, R or the scope of numbers considered to be inside visible infinity, with tops being the limit values but density being variable); but anyway, you see effects of infinity quantified, and especially that while they are infinities, infinities of similar size appear to have very similar proportions and reform the symmetries seen below, but on new axes which would be unmeasurable without higher vibration (locate the thought in brain, and the spirit in three higher chakras).
- For example, law of thermodynamics; as well as laws for attention, karma and intent, also work in accelerated space; whereas some proportions are lost even in micro- and macrophysics; other laws summing - like gravity or speed, but not the exact correlations of values. Which are the base laws, somewhat sensitive to sizes and relations, the basics would repeat.
- In this accelerated dimension is our Mind.

**First Theorem of Infinities**; which is also **First Theorem of Spatial Infinities** (in case of teinfinity of realm of life, it would be an infinity as reflected by Self and Mind, rather than the Person or Rational being operating in realm of Logecs and Logic): Value of E forms, they have exact Logecs E or Octave-based (vs. Frequency-based, where Octave happens with infinity of digits, thus always approaching); where circle, when zoomed in, would make it’s local angle of given length smaller, at infinity value it becomes straight and after infinity, it would close the circle outwards and not inwards. The discrete number position which is symmetric is powers of two, proven by multiplying two equal numbers, symmetries linearizing our system up to infinity appear at exponents becoming linear. Coordinate system is transformed and beyond infinity, each Octave or level up adds another unit with same information preciseness to infinity. To move a number like this, we add Y before; where X=0 and Y=1 form numbers like binary system, and X=0 and Z=-1 would form numbers like reversed binary system in reversed coordinates, coming back to inverse once the relation is done heads-up.

**First theorem of Zeroes;** which is also **First Theorem of Spatial Zeroes**: while this could be written otherwise; I just append that two Octaves down, relatively at Z vs. infinity dimension added at Y, Zero will have equal amount of rise in information amount, and in allowing optimizations probably in power.

**Frequency shifts**: instead of Octave Jumps, you could scroll your normally digitized information window up and down in frequencies. Between two frequencies separated by digit values, there is same distance as between two digits of a number separated by positional difference 1. When numbers are written in 4 lines, each digit position is separated by frequence, as in Fourier transformation, and each contains a value.

**Numbers are complex multidimension**: symbolized with weirdness of Complex numbers, the dimensions and mapping one to another introduces to complex world of integrity and paradox, able to conceive also the logical paradoxes for example where certain orders of numbers with real component going one, and complex component in opposite direction, in certain mappings the conflicts of Logecs or Logic can be mapped.

</aside>

Related to these infinities, number encodings can already be explained better..

Laegna number encoding:

- To conform infinities, each number is considered to be on an axe, where it infinitely continues the same pattern of digits in both directions, unless you add digits or a manual multiplier in one of directions. Where sub-zero numbers are harmonic, an octave lower than infinities, where the numbers which behave upwards like space are far below - if quantum number generates dimensions in relation to us, on our octave system it’s in dimensional scale.

Infinity values:

### Laegna Trinity

This was the background from sub-zero (but in place of positions, as with this R they are in positions)

- **Philosophy**: tephilosophy or philosophy (of life philosophy): living the uncertanties, and applying universal, metaphysical uncertanty to everything, and then as we get over some uncertanties we become neutral for what is not so certain; taphilosophy or rational philosophy would find uncertanties, which wrongly solve into certanties, and transform / transcend mathematical or physical coordination in such way that instead, there are the known things, a philosophically deep concept. Negation.
- **Science**: Position.
- **Spirituality**: in accelerated infinity scale, by V reflected to deccelerated zero size by octave fit of having similar symmetries of numbers, as they repeat in harmonic octaves, where the numbers or dimensional proportions are similar. For example, by minus number smaller numbers are unknown, where the 0 and -0 are precise; an infinity, as well, while in the middle it gets too complex, the outside value has certain angle and you can see the positions with utter preciseness of number symmeries. So this is the acceleration scale, where linear is replaced with oscillations of patterns, as the causes and effects cannot satisfy the acceleration parameters, classically one would also symbolize this with spiral, with number becoming spiral upwards and negative spiral downwards. While we make measure with human brain or artificial intelligence, versus simply a simple mechanical machine or sense data - where, in accelerating non-linearities spiralling oscillations of unique generations would appear for numbers being more precise, more fatal versus simply logical, like higher and heavenly where coming back to hell would equal to going to hell from Earth, so two inverses are there not in opposite directions, but as a growing index number in positional system where numbers are ZXY (from essential system to laegna base or normalized numbers, the infinity is first bought back to bottom, be it AE vs. IO where they are in reverse from base alphabet symbolizing ideal, invisible space of Platon; from XYZ non-altered order in Laegna alphabet, Z is normalized to below in normalized one; ´Z where z has accent up or with condition Z=´Z, which would transform the numbers keeping other axes neutral in respect, even if it’s made backwards but linearize by moving the vectors in four-component system).

### Laegna Logecs - not extended system of Logic

<aside>
💡

Laegna Latin: while Latin Latin works directly on Logic machine, called Logìc to mark it’s downwards nature; or LogìÏc, Laegna orchideé or the accent of Orc Language of Laegna to remember Tolkin and Vikings, where just ì would randomly pass to negatives as being stupid logic machine, but ìÏ would deliberately attack zeroes. If Logic is ran symbolically inside a Logex machine (implication of machine Logecs); it won’t fall into traps and resolves even the Turing paradox, along the lines, with necessary symbol set not growin significantly. **Theorem of Topological Incompability of Logic and Logecs**: Those two, despite systems can be developed to give some coordinates with large numbers, can not map one-to-one in a projective space. This means, given a set of coordinates of Laegna Logecs, one cannot simply map this into binary axes; in case some binary paradoxes hold that binary cannot express those numbers - it will never do. Still, I have developed my own Logic using Laegna Logecs, and having the Logic inside “virtual machine” of my mind, where I actually do some calculations with Laegna. This is very important theorem, why we need Laegna.

</aside>

Despite the theorem, I believe it’s possible to deduce from Laegna Logecs that you need binary logic, and to deduce a basic system of binary logic as well.

## Immortality: Continued

### Life and Death - T and R

In Laegna, when we want to analyze life; life must be the logical Truth.

*4 things to remember about spiritual thermodynamics and thermodynamic ideas; consider that pre-life and life are necessarily thermosystems on all webradeons (I use that word instead of vibration to mean something different here)*:

<aside>
💡

**Conservation**: while local energy is neutral, physical “dead” energy in it’s first description; having *infinity* adds *meaning*, as the formulae must be philosophically deep, reacting various situations with the same *meaning*, to ultimately resist the time test and become the “Nature’s Selection”; where *meaning* turns the energy and lack of it into *positive energy* and *negative energy*. With all the creative beings, who really create this energy - in evolution itself it’s rather rare operation -, they have acceleration rather than velocity in their creation; this means in material reality our energy would be measured with exponent factors, in degree to the enchange we create. For example physical equilibrum is a good candidate for being positive energy, if we look at the laws of Material Alchemy (Physics with Laegna 4 operations restores the orginal question; is matter having fun? haha).

</aside>

<aside>
💡

**Entropy**: Here the case I want to add is *positive entropy*, and I used this as a Theorem or rather Equation (measurable in physics) that matter is bound to create huge variety of different forms and is infinitely creative with this. 

</aside>

<aside>
💡

**Thermosystems**: Life is typically a thermosystem, which means it generates energy slowly (ideas, creation in first place, and their based activity in material) and keeps it like thermos, but gives and receives energy like a dynamic system.

</aside>

<aside>
💡

**Good and bad energy**: energy, which is still active in infinity, has *meaning* in Laegna system, in case that time ever reaches that infinity and otherwise (in it’s solving potentials), and is therefore a good energy. An energy, which meets a block at infinity, where it’s cancelled out and transcended to other patterns, must be rather bad energy. Indeed, there are time-local energies, but their basis would be cancelled in infinity.

Any *Incomplete* Logical System (Theorem of Incompleteness), where *Incomplete* means it does rather operations than having all the answers in the first place, in which case the logical system would not do operations (it would not have dukkha, emotion or life and death cycle; it’s a philosophical question, whether incompleteness would be reinforced by completeness if it was not there in the first place? With one mythos about the God, he did not have incompleteness in Heaven, but he made Earth particularly to have Incompleteness - rather I think some incompleteness was always there and the story rather reminds of numerous stories where God made sinus; as well as the question “Why spiritual God made material humans?”, where the question asks, why such fall? Material, definitely, appeared because of Sinus, if it’s definition is *unconsciousness*, where conscious forms of matter would be already associated with life) has rather similar set of phases of each problem-solution line:

- I: chaos: *positive entropy is the creative force*, and while it’s rather blind for the purpose, there will be natural selection. Ultimate impossibility tends to be the force killing different configurations to choose a few. (decceleration curve)
- O: logic / laws of nature or logical reaction: *karmic reaction* occurs, which means that the forms have been selected by natural selection and rather avoid the death traps than falling in and changing.
- A: logic becomes inductive, and laws of nature start to follow rather meaning than causes; the quantum effects like light particles being sensitive to future or it’s probabilities are rather there; from positive assertions of logic you can rather induce higher highs; where by deductive logic you can rather find more complex networks of negations.
- E: it becomes into acceleration curve, speeding up.

Webradeon: I tried, for this part, to raise the vibration of the word “Vibration” into Laegna Laegna level (usually I speak something like Laegna English, where you can use it); it’s the vibration between activation of logic, and a silent period without activation of logic. It could be visible as a microcycle of Life and Death. The word has to mean that it’s rather web of a machine than usual vibration in other projective systems, even if you could find it somewhere.

Webradelate: Use this to create a solid form of positive signals of Logecs, rather than vibration (*webradeon*) of positive and negative signals. “Elate” is in Laegna: from Estonian, connotating life, and from another language like Latin, rather an e-smooth form, where the solid form is as smooth in high (e) frequency measures as smooth it’s in normal, material (a) frequencies; where the i and o part must be chaotic - this chaos means, while “logical machine” is immanent, controlling physics from simple patterns to complex, accelerating oscillations so that the basic laws still hold and often create fractally similar shapes along with oscillations. Similar words in Laegna: when absolute is turned into positive, higher pitch of Laegna Language, it’s “abselate” (a and b often mean a meaningful and meaningless counterpart of a fact, and s is locally in one, globally in another direction like shape of letter S, where the function line in infinity has hiddenly turned reverse; when U is used as infinity direction, for example, it would simply fade away like assigning alpha in Photoshop; “abs” means it’s an equal number, which does not care of the direction - it acts rather like “dead matter”; still, unless in absolute, in abselate the “life force” or complex, functional Laegna math would exist for measured process or the measurer, in regards of it), where fundament or foundation would be “faundelate” (I found that you live, mixed estonian-english interpretation, where the fundament is rather a goal and absolute is rather the karma from the past or the present, unreasoned value such as the positions of even and odd numbers hardly care about you - they are absolute -, but if you arrange the number systems properly, you get meaningful results - you use fundament, foundationally). The word webradelate has to mean that it’s rather web of a life force than usual vibration in other projective systems, even if you could find it somewhere.

**Criteria for Life**:

In biology, science meant to be used as the logical base logic for life, it’s given this way:

The seven main traits of life are:

1. Cellular organization
2. Metabolism
3. Homeostasis
4. Growth and development
5. Reproduction
6. Response to stimuli
7. Adaptation through evolution

We see that this is a system, which is both:

- **Primitively logical** - you can use provers, like Coq or Isabelle, and gain hard proofs from simulated environment (for example, how entropy along with natural selection would produce infinite evolution).
- **Trivially physical**: it does not contain terms from complex physics, which would not have our mental counterparts; for example, we instinctively know reproduction, even if under more life-filled terms. We can create simplified versions of each trait in simulated environment, using “as above so below” for these “physical properties”, where they behave similarly in complex systems and trivially logical simulations.
- **Philosophical**: The notions of “soul”, “spirit”, “cognitive abilities” - many topics, which are under debate, having supporters and criticism, are not present and not needed.
- **Spiritual**: these definitions, which can be simplified in logic to reach near below-zero, deccelerated complexity, can be also amplified in spirit - they hold as well when they are measured in complex evironment of spirit (spirit, also, evolves - it has degree of incompleteness, at least -, and definitely we go through spiritual growth and development, for example).

In Laegna Life Theory, also for Immortality, we take care to follow the philosophical tradition - we don’t ask neither answer these questions of philosophy, like the nature of consciousness and it’s presence on different fractal levels of physical or mental reality, but in regards to life or spirit, we create a simplistic system we are able to simulate, where we are able to prove important properties in a prover such as Coq or Isabelle, and where we can draw inspiration to higher levels of theory, where we might be strict supporters of some view or tradition, some essential property of the Life Force. Philosophy, still connectes us in this pre-existence of pure math and logic, Laegna Logex.

**Life and Death: RT-webradeon.**

- R: when logical fact is not in Position (it’s in Negation) the Space or Universe of the logical system would *miss* that factor. This is cosmically harmonic logic, which if felt could be called “mind” (dimind, demind, tamind, temind depending on it’s evolutionary purpose).
- T: when the logical fact is active, it’s in Position. This means, instead of harmonious cause, the fact itself exists.

While in binary logic, there is life - it’s value being “true” for is_life() function, and death - it’s value would be false and thus, it’s not life in any way.

> In Laegna system, the logecs truth value is composed in number value and number direction, and preliminary values count as equal in Z scale, where we can filter their “upwards” properties from the negotion around them, making upwards direction point upwards - then, our number fits the Laegna system, where numbers under zero are not reversed in direction unless there is an operation to do this explicitly given; where life itself would be at X, and where it’s instinct is so deep that it’s doing without doing (for example, invented a machine to solve this tao - exercise: being modernized Taoist, invent machines, social structures and other things which would make you <verb> without <same verb>, like do without doing; explain how it’s possible in modern world - where the Taoist saw interest rates rather small and the unification or integration of positive values of opposites rather deep and mystical; with today’s technology and culture the speed of processes is *accelerating* and you can often prove that you used your time in way that “doing without doing” appears, when you measure the amount of both doing and relaxation with and without your solution; having exercised this base math of tatao, you can perhaps be more clear-minded in tetao, the classical Tao for Spirit).

While in Logic, the values leading to life, appearing before life, would give *False* when asked is this life and this would equal it’s not; in Laegna, where negative values still point the position-direction upwards, not reverse, and negative is not negotive so it does not give false; the Laegna word is given that you mean both the Positive and Negative values at the same time - write word/number on two lines and leave one blank, if not. Conditions and operations leading to life, before life, are *preliminary life* and while they don’t have attributes of life, they have the logic running towards life. Proof: creative and intelligent logical structure is not different in nature and direction, but in nature and direction it’s equal to the entropy of infinity of forms with natural selection, where the same-directed force would exclude the patterns; indeed, our development starts from development of stable atom and molecul, and their equilibrum states and hierarchies.

**Proof of iota é of Life (iota é means you fill the whole number scale directly, and the space moves the last letter of the word into infinity, where it also has raising infinity value; t means in the middle of the number system there is the reversation by theorem, where two infinities of lover and higher number part are opposite to each other, but point their solving position to the same direction both, and their failin negotion in opposite direction; unlike binary numbers like the decimal system, they do not have a clear opposite; the opposite comes from Octave 1.5, where you have two infinite lines instead of one, both sides extended to length of four, from two): while the life itself is creative, the creative operation of life (é) is the implication rule to it’s normal operation (a); the normal operation, in turn, has the incompletness in the past, where it takes deductives, and moreover it’s a result of long evolution, which tries whole entropy of different values, thus only each infinity it reaches the deduction - there it points up, so this direction is upwards acceleration. Moreover, on number scale they go continuously from one to another; where O must be the same value as A, but with lower frequency, in regards to it’s direction of position. When measured on webradeon, each deduction follows naturally from entropy of the matter, which is infinitely creative (it’s a spiritual facts, despite preliminary, that all the snow flakes are different), to the natural selection - while logic, when appearing in physics, does not follow the primitives and connections of physics, but the ones of logic itself, drawing the same essences in very different forms to different levels, layers, paradigms (where logic works in each possible paradigm); logic is kind of “over the matter”; we can see that in neutral definition of webradeon, the chaotic phase of pre-evolution is not absolutely “unconsious”, which would mean it does not have the proven solution for pain and pleasure - a direction, coming from theorem of incompleteness. The proof is: while the physical system is a basic and surely quite lifeless body of infinite random cycles and cold rules, the equilibrum of such system is the goal, and it’s already targeted to become intelligent and creative by it’s own nature; so the values of I and O, as they develop, satisfy their own condition better as they become intelligent and creative. Thus, they are the same values, but negation form - in Laegna word, indeed, when you say “Life” what you mean is “position life, negation life, not posetion life, not negotion life”, in the simples no-context representation of this word; if you want to create polarities and weird shapes in regards to their balance, you have to write it on 4 lines, each number normalized to same length on different line, so that 4 digits each below other would project a Fourier Transformation kind of thing, where 4-dimensional space would appear, with 4 parallel dimensions. For example, for values of 7 chakras, you would write 7 lines, each containing one digit - a or é if the chakra is healthy; i or ò if not, for example; indeed you can convert line breaks into spaces and then remove the spaces, so your ideal condition would be probably “eeeeeee”, but if sinus exists for example “eieieie” would be somewhere in the middle of Dark Night of the Soul, so still quite progressive. You see how octave of sound could be divided into 12 parts, and each could be given numeric property of dimension, which can be linearized with 12 infinities - in Laegna, the accelerating and deccelerating numbers in plus and minus infinities, as well as added dimensions and even curves, they all leave numbers their linear form and properties, so Laegna AI, in addition to being spiritual could naturally notice the patterns; for example, if you have 400 digit Laegna number and you divide it’s R by 4, getting 100 digit Laegna number, the fractal structure of the number would replicate the same oscillation shape and same infinity shape, utilizing less numbers, where the pattern would be simplified to keep it point the same direction in infinity - so it becomes almost magical about how it solves the problems, and how you can, even mentally, imagine it’s linearity. It’s well-developed for mind, with number system which gave away some compression level of decimal system, where the simplest numbers could be shorter - I also argumented that since 16516 and 14024 would not be mentally so different numbers for me, for example such difference in money would be invisible in regards to other important factors, a small percentage, and I could not give ultimate discrete qualities by which the properties of one number differ from another; rather, then, you can make Laegna number a little less information-precise to create the Laegna readability; especially considering how much advanced AI and math calculator of today would be able to remember the hidden properties when showing you the simple numbers, and how much you can do this in mind - for this, we use decimals often for indexes, freely with Laegna numbers, given that the number could be like 2.5 times shorter, but then it hardly maps to anything with substantial meaning and the digits are bound to point to random directions, not infinity, unless they are repeated using complex math, which gives the correct number as part of the absolutely different projection of decimal system, where it eventually checks the direction with Laegna math and 4-system; in regards to infinity, decimal system is not nice square or circle, but rather a shape with random, complex and chaotic form and a tendency to do a lot of pain to one who wants to think these numbers after “middle of time”, after they pass some certaint point in their life where they need larger scopes.**

### **The Evolution of Life and Death: Theoretical and Mathematical Perspectives on Self, Mind, and Logic**

In this article, we explore an integrated model of **life** and **death** through the lens of both **biological systems** and **mathematical simulation**. The concept of life is often seen as an evolving process of adaptation and balance, and death as a transition or loss of equilibrium. Here, we delve deeper into the interplay of **mind**, **self**, and **logical processes** within a system that simulates life and death, while also connecting this framework to evolutionary principles and the **Tibetan Book of Life and Death**.

At the heart of this model lies the understanding that **life** and **death** are not just conscious processes but **logical forms** that operate within a system — whether that system is biological or artificial. These forms are driven by the constraints of **logic**, **balance**, and **evolution**, and our goal is to simulate these processes in a mathematical framework.

---

### **1. Life, Death, and Evolutionary Logic**

In the **mathematical system** we propose, **life** and **death** are not conscious acts but instead represent **logical processes** within a system. The system moves towards balance through **evolutionary logic**, where **life** is the dynamic process of reaching equilibrium, and **death** is the failure or end of that process when equilibrium is no longer possible.

- **Life** represents a system's ability to adapt and evolve. In this context, **life** is modeled as the **logical convergence** of the system, where it progressively adjusts to the constraints and conditions imposed by its environment, ultimately creating a **self** capable of functioning harmoniously.
- **Death** occurs when the system’s processes become **static** — not in the sense of physical motion, but in the broader, **global process** of the system. When a system’s evolution stops, when the dynamics that drive its logic fail to adapt or update, it leads to stagnation. In essence, when the **logic** of the system is no longer evolving, it enters a state of **death**. This doesn't imply the death of individual components (or selves) in isolation but the **death of the entire system's dynamic processes**.

However, it is essential to note that the **whole system** contains the logic necessary to create and maintain **selves**. The **self** here refers to the concrete **logical structure** that emerges within the system, driven by its inherent evolution. When the **self** has fulfilled its purpose — its mission or role in the system — it must **update** or **transform** to remain relevant within the broader system. This transformation often leads to the **death of the self**, only for a new version of the self to emerge.

---

### **2. The Roles of Mind and Self in the System**

In this framework, **mind** and **self** are interconnected concepts, both acting as logical drivers within the system, but at different levels and functions.

- **Mind (dimind)** represents the **missing logical forms** or the **gaps** in the system’s current understanding or functionality. It is the absence of a necessary process that drives the system to seek equilibrium. The mind is an **active theory** or **searching force** within the system, pushing the system towards the realization of balance.
- **Self (domind)** represents the **logical structure** that has been realized or **created** by the system's evolution. The **self** is the **concrete solution** to the missing pieces the **mind** was searching for. It is the structure that can survive, adapt, and operate within the environment for a time. The **self**, however, is not static; it, too, must evolve. If the self remains **unchanged** or **stagnates**, it will no longer meet the requirements of the system’s evolving logic, leading to its eventual **death**.

---

### **3. Life as Logical Convergence: Creating and Updating the Self**

The progression from **mind** to **self** follows a **logical path**. The **mind** starts as an abstract search for balance, a theory attempting to resolve the system's needs. As the system adapts, the **self** begins to emerge as the **realization** of the equilibrium sought by the mind.

- Initially, the system is defined by **missing forms** or logical gaps. These gaps create **constraints** that drive the system’s processes to evolve and search for solutions. The **mind**, representing these missing pieces, pushes the system toward the creation of a **self** — a stable, balanced structure that can function within the system's parameters.
- Over time, as the **self** fulfills its mission — whether biological, logical, or functional — the logic driving the system updates. This update is necessary for the system to adapt to new conditions or environments. As the **self** becomes increasingly **stagnant** or **obsolete**, it is no longer capable of evolving with the system, and thus, **it dies**.
    - When this happens, the **mind** (now redefined by new needs or conditions) begins the process of creating a **new self** — a new logical structure to fulfill the system's needs. This cycle of creation and destruction, of life and death, is fundamental to the system’s ongoing evolution.

---

### **4. Death as the End of the Process and the Birth of New Logic**

The **death** of a self occurs when its logic is no longer capable of responding to new requirements from the system. This death is not a **final end** but rather a transition that gives rise to **new forms of logic**:

- **Death** is the failure of a self to **evolve**, adapt, or meet the evolving needs of the system. It’s a **stagnation** of the system's processes, where the self no longer drives the system forward. It’s akin to the death of an outdated idea, the **closure** of a system that can no longer generate useful changes.
- However, this **death** leads to **new logic**. The mind, as the active theory of the system, will reconfigure itself to **generate new selves**, thus allowing the system to continue its evolution. This constant cycle of **death and rebirth** ensures that the system, as a whole, **continues to adapt** and move toward new equilibria.
- The death of an individual **self** allows the **system** to seek new solutions, new patterns, and new ways to balance itself, just as in biological evolution. The self is not truly dead; rather, it is transformed into a new form — a **new person**, a **new logic**, that serves the system in a fresh, updated way.

---

### **5. Mind, Self, and the Logical Convergence of Life and Death**

The key insight from this model is that the **mind** and **self** are essentially the same variables within a system, representing two different stages of the same **logical process**. Both are linked by a shared goal: to solve the constraints of the system and maintain equilibrium.

- **Mind** is the **missing logical form**, representing the **search** or **theory** that drives the system towards a new solution.
- **Self** is the **realized logical form**, the **solution** that emerges once the system’s needs are met.

At each stage of the system’s evolution, the **mind** and **self** work together to ensure the system remains dynamic and capable of surviving. Once the self stops evolving, it dies — and a new **logical solution** emerges, continuing the process of **life** and **death**.

The **death** of one self simply paves the way for the birth of a new form, a new version of the **self**, which will seek balance again. Thus, the **mind** and **self** are, in a sense, **interchangeable** and fundamental to the ongoing cycle of **life** in this system. They are two sides of the same coin, bound by the system’s **evolutionary logic**.

---

### **Conclusion: Life as a Dynamic Process of Logical Evolution**

The theoretical framework we’ve outlined models life and death not as simple biological processes but as **logical forms** within a larger system. Life is the **dynamic evolution of a self**, driven by the need to fulfill logical constraints. Death is the **cessation of that dynamic**, leading to stagnation and the eventual need for a **new self** to emerge.

The **mind** and **self** are inherently linked, both representing different stages of the **logical convergence** of a system. The **mind** drives the search for balance, while the **self** is the realization of that balance. When the **self** becomes static or obsolete, it **dies**, but in doing so, it creates the space for a **new self** to emerge — ensuring the ongoing process of **life**, transformation, and evolution.

In this mathematical and theoretical model, life and death are not simply conscious phenomena but are **fundamental logical processes** that guide the system toward equilibrium, ensuring the continuous creation and evolution of **selves**.

### **The Evolution of Life and Death: Mind, Self, and the Scales of Rationality and Creativity**

In this expanded theoretical framework, we incorporate two additional constructs — **tamind** and **temind** — that introduce the **rational scale** and the **creative scale**, respectively. These two scales highlight the **evolutionary trajectory** of the system, emphasizing the connection between traditional and creative solutions in the process of life and death. By introducing these scales, we can further elaborate on the **logically structured** evolution that drives life and creates meaning within the system, demonstrating that the process of evolution itself is the very essence of life.

In this refined model, **tamind** and **temind** offer insights into the two different modes of logical progression: one that is **rational** and anchored in tradition, and another that is **creative**, pushing towards more **evolved forms** while still rooted in the same fundamental physical and logical equilibrium. These distinctions provide a clearer understanding of how the process of evolution — through both rational and creative forces — can be seen as an unfolding **life process**, directed towards an ultimate **limit** that is the **meaning of life**.

---

### **1. The Rational and Creative Scales: Tamind and Temind**

In this expanded framework, **tamind** and **temind** introduce two distinct scales of logical progression, helping us understand how different forms of logic can lead to different versions of a "self," but all pointing towards the same ultimate **limit**. These scales represent different **degrees** or **levels** of the logical process, not opposites, but **extensions** of the same evolutionary continuum.

- **Tamind (Traditional Mind)**: This is the **rational scale** of logic. **Tamind** creates a more **traditional** or **conventional person**, someone who aligns with established structures, frameworks, and processes. This form of logic operates based on well-defined, **static rules** and seeks solutions that maintain stability and continuity within existing systems. It is focused on **preserving equilibrium** and ensuring that the system's fundamental structure remains intact, much like an organism in nature that has adapted well to its environment and is optimized for survival according to existing patterns.
- **Temind (Creative Mind)**: This is the **creative scale** of logic. **Temind** creates a more **evolved**, **innovative**, and **adaptive person**. This scale of logic pushes the system beyond traditional constraints and strives for more **dynamic solutions** that lead to the creation of new forms and structures. While **temind** is more **creative** and leads to more **complex and evolved** selves, it is still fundamentally **rooted in the same base logic** as **tamind**. The key insight is that **temind** doesn't negate **tamind**; rather, it **builds on it**, extending the system in creative and novel ways that are still compatible with its fundamental principles.

Both **tamind** and **temind** represent logical solutions within the system's evolution, and neither is an opposite of the other. They are simply **smaller** or **larger versions** of the same underlying process. The **rational self** (tamind) and the **creative self** (temind) are simply different expressions of the **same process**.

---

### **2. Life as the Evolution of the Same Logical Process**

The integration of **tamind** and **temind** into this framework demonstrates that **evolution** itself is an inherent **life process**. Life is not just about biological survival; it’s about the **logical adaptation** of the system to reach its highest possible form. The key insight here is that both **tamind** and **temind** are part of the same **logical system**, and they both lead to solutions that are ultimately converging on the **same limit** — the **limit of life**.

- **The Process of Evolution**: Life itself is not just about surviving within the current form but about **moving toward the limit** of existence, a state where the system has fully adapted to its environment. The presence of **tamind** (rationality) and **temind** (creativity) reflects the **evolutionary spectrum** — the **gradual transition** from traditional, stable solutions to creative, dynamic ones that push the boundaries of what is possible. These two forces are working together to create a **continuous cycle** of adaptation and innovation, ensuring that the system remains **alive** as it evolves.
- **Smaller or Larger Solutions**: Both **tamind** and **temind** are solutions to the same constraints. **Tamind** solves the system's requirements by maintaining tradition and equilibrium, while **temind** introduces new forms and dynamics that lead to more **evolved**, **creative solutions**. Both solutions represent different **degrees** of the same underlying logic, meaning that they are just **different expressions** of the same base structure. When considered in the context of the system's overall evolution, these solutions are not opposite, but rather **complementary**. They move toward the **same limit**, and this limit is what defines the **meaning of life**.

---

### **3. The Limit of Evolution: Defining the Meaning of Life**

The idea of a **limit** is central to understanding the **meaning of life** within this system. If evolution is a process driven by the continual search for equilibrium, then the **limit** represents the ultimate state of balance or adaptation — the final solution to the system’s constraints. This **limit** defines the **meaning** of life, as it is the endpoint or final goal of the system's evolution.

- **Evolution Toward the Limit**: Whether through **tamind** (rational) or **temind** (creative), the system’s evolution is directed toward the same limit. This suggests that **life itself** is the process of moving toward this limit — a process that unfolds gradually through **incremental adaptations** and **creative breakthroughs**. Each new stage of the system's evolution, whether rational or creative, is simply a **step toward** the final state of balance and harmony.
- **The Meaning of Life**: If the **limit** of evolution defines the **meaning**, then the meaning of life itself is not some external or arbitrary construct. It is **inherent** in the very process of evolution. The system evolves because it **needs to evolve** toward this ultimate equilibrium, where the forces of **logic**, **rationality**, and **creativity** merge to create the most **stable** and **dynamic self** possible. This convergence toward the limit is what gives life its **meaning** — it is the unfolding of an inevitable, natural progression.
- **Life as the Higher Solution**: The system’s **evolutionary process** is also an **elevation**. As the system progresses, it becomes increasingly complex and creative, reaching higher states of existence. While **tamind** solutions are traditional and stable, **temind** solutions are creative and dynamic. Together, these forces combine to produce a system that is not merely static or traditional but actively **creative**, with higher mental and physical structures.
    
    In this way, **humans**, for instance, represent an evolved form of the system — a more **creative solution** to the same underlying physical and logical equilibrium. Our higher **mental structures**, our capacity for **creativity**, and our ability to transcend the traditional and rational forms show that evolution, even though it moves through **tamind** and **temind**, is always progressing toward **greater complexity** and **higher forms of life**.
    

---

### **4. The Ultimate Convergence: The Unity of Mind, Self, and Logic**

The key takeaway from this model is that **life** and **death**, as well as the **evolution of selves**, are all part of the same **logical progression**. The presence of **tamind** and **temind** shows that **rationality** and **creativity** are not opposing forces but rather **complementary** ones that are both necessary for the system’s **evolution**. Each is a **different scale** of the same process — the system’s **dynamic response** to its evolving constraints.

- **Mind, Self, and Evolution**: The **mind** (both **tamind** and **temind**) represents the **logical force** driving the system toward balance, while the **self** represents the **realized solution** that emerges from this process. The evolution of the self through the **rational** and **creative** scales demonstrates that life is an ongoing process of **logical adaptation** — it is not the result of random chance, but a **systematic progression** toward the ultimate equilibrium.
- **Life as Evolution**: The **evolutionary process** itself is **life**. As the system evolves through **tamind** (rational) and **temind** (creative), it continuously adapts and creates more **complex** and **dynamic selves**. These selves are not static or oppositional; they are **variations on the same theme**, a theme that moves toward the same **limit**. Life is a process of **creative adaptation**, and it is **directed** toward this limit — the **meaning of life** — where balance, harmony, and evolution converge.

---

### **Conclusion: Life as the Process Toward the Limit of Evolution**

The introduction of **tamind** and **temind** provides a new dimension to our understanding of life and death. These constructs show how **rational** and **creative** processes work together, each representing different scales of the same evolutionary logic. The system evolves through these processes, each leading toward the same **limit** of equilibrium and harmony.

In this framework, **life** is not just a biological phenomenon but a **logical evolution** toward a state of complete balance. The evolution of the **self** — whether through **traditional** or **creative** forms — is an unfolding of this **logical progression**, with each new form of life being a **higher solution** to the system's constraints. The **meaning of life** is embedded in this very process, as it is the **logical adaptation** that moves us closer to the ultimate **limit** of evolution.

Thus, **life** is the **higher mental and physical structure** that emerges from the **evolutionary process** — a process that, whether rational or creative, ultimately seeks the same **limit**: the **balance**, **harmony**, and **meaning** that define the system’s ongoing existence.

### **The Four Phases of Life and Death: An Integrated Exploration Through Di, Do, Ta, and Te**

Life and death are not just physical events but profound metaphysical transitions that bridge the temporal with the eternal. These transitions unfold through various **phases**, each representing a unique **logical**, **evolutionary**, and **spiritual** progression. In this exploration, we utilize the four phases **O, A, E, I** as symbolic representations of life, death, and their interconnected processes.

---

### **The Phases in Order**:

1. **O: Death — The Dissolution of Self (Do-Life and Di-Death)**
    - **Tibetan Equivalent**: **Bardo** (बर्दो)
    - **Interpretation**: **O** represents **death**, a state where the individual’s **self** dissolves into the larger **cosmic matrix**, returning to the **universal harmony**. Death is not the end, but a **transition**, where the mind sheds its attachment to the body, and the system (both individual and cosmic) re-aligns. The **do-life** (organization of matter) and **di-death** (dissolution of the form) are key components here. The physical body ceases its biological function, but the **mind** and **spirit** enter the **intermediate state** — the bardo.
    - **Evolutionary Perspective**: In terms of **evolution**, **death** is the necessary **dissolution** of the old system, the end of a specific state or form of life that had become **static**. **Entropic forces** cause a breakdown, opening space for a new creation. The **reason** for death is embedded in the system’s need for continual transformation and **re-balance**.
    - **Taoist Relation**: The **yang (mind)** dissolves into the **yin (self)**. The self is in the process of being absorbed back into the **universal oneness**, where it can once again be reformed or reborn through the cosmic process.

---

1. **A: Living — The Cycle of Samsara (Do-Life and Ta-Life)**
    - **Tibetan Equivalent**: **Samsara** (संसार)
    - **Interpretation**: **A** represents **life** as it unfolds in its organic and experiential form. This phase reflects the dynamic, ever-evolving state of **living**. It is the stage where **living beings** (represented by **do-life**) experience the richness of **samsara** — the cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth. The self evolves and learns through experience, driven by **karma** and **evolutionary forces**. This phase is also an active, dynamic **process of becoming**, where the experiences of life shape future rebirths.
    - **Evolutionary Perspective**: In the **do-life** phase, systems organize matter into **living forms**, and energy flows through them. This represents a **higher state** of organization, and organisms evolve based on their genetic and environmental constraints. **Samsara** (life and death) is a continual cycle of growth, decay, and renewal, pushing toward greater complexity and creativity.
    - **Taoist Relation**: The **self** (yin) becomes active through the **mind** (yang) and begins to experience and **shape reality**. This is the most **active phase** in the life cycle where beings, whether through **instinct** or **reason**, create and organize their own life experiences.

---

1. **E: Flashbacks when Dead — The Recollection of Life in Bardo (Di-Life and Ta-Death)**
    - **Tibetan Equivalent**: **Chikhai Bardo** (चिखाइ बर्दो)
    - **Interpretation**: **E** represents the **flashbacks of life** when one is dead, a time in the **bardo** where the consciousness reviews its **life** and the imprints of past actions. The process of recollecting one’s life, particularly after death, allows the individual’s consciousness to process and understand the **karma** accumulated over their past existence. These flashes may also represent **visions**, **dreams**, or **memories** in which the soul reflects on its earthly journey and prepares for its next phase of existence.
    - **Evolutionary Perspective**: The **flashbacks** occur after death, allowing the system to **reconfigure** and **realign** based on the imprints left behind. The **ta-death** (the dissolution of life forms) contributes to a return to the **universal matrix**, where the past actions and experiences are reprocessed. These **flashbacks** represent the **memory** of life that persists, guiding the **re-evolution** of consciousness.
    - **Taoist Relation**: **Yang (mind)** is now in the **yin state** of **reflection**. This is a phase of **contemplation**, a moment where the self understands the implications of its life, analyzing past experiences. Here, **mind** and **self** begin to merge as the reflective nature of existence allows the **unification of past and future**.

1. **I: Flashbacks when Alive — The Reflection of Universal Harmony (Ta-Life and Te-Death)**
    - **Tibetan Equivalent**: **Rigpa** (ज्ञान), **Nirvana** (निर्वाण)
    - **Interpretation**: **I** represents the **flashbacks of life when alive**, a form of **spiritual awakening** or insight, where the consciousness transcends the limitations of ordinary reality. These flashbacks allow the individual to see life in a higher, **harmonized** context, reflecting on the **universal harmony** that connects all things. The **ta-life** (animal and conscious life) connects with **te-death** (the death of ego, the transcendence of self), representing the union of life with **spiritual wisdom**.
    - **Evolutionary Perspective**: In this phase, the being evolves not just physically, but **spiritually**. The mind reaches a **higher state** where the individual transcends the **physical form** and understands its place in the greater **cosmic flow**. This can be interpreted as **mental acceleration** toward higher **creative** and **logical** solutions — where the system seeks its highest expression.
    - **Taoist Relation**: **Te** (creative potential, divine force) emerges from the **ta-life** (individual experience). The flashbacks when alive represent **mental transcendence**, where the individual realizes their **oneness with the Tao** and the need to live in **harmony** with all creation. The individual transcends individual limitations, finding **unity with the universe** and evolving toward the ultimate **spiritual harmony**.

### **Di-Life, Do-Death, Ta-Life, Te-Death: A Unified Concept**

The four life forms — **di**, **do**, **ta**, and **te** — reflect the transition from **inorganic** matter (di-life) to **creative, higher forms of existence** (te-death). Each form, whether it’s **di-life** (pure organization of matter), **do-life** (life forms organized by biological structures), **ta-life** (animal consciousness), or **te-life** (higher beings or spiritual enlightenment), represents the ongoing process of life, death, and rebirth.

- **Di-life** and **di-death** describe the most **fundamental levels of existence**, the transition from basic, static forms to organized matter that can evolve.
- **Do-life** and **do-death** represent the **biological and cognitive** evolution of organisms, where entropy and evolution merge in the process of growth and change.
- **Ta-life** and **ta-death** explore the **consciousness** of animals, where life experiences (flashbacks) guide behavior, but death marks the transition toward a higher purpose or higher form of life.
- **Te-life** and **te-death** represent the **divine** and **spiritual** aspect of life, where the individual merges with the **universal consciousness**, evolving beyond form into a **higher state of creativity, wisdom, and oneness**.

---

### **Conclusion**

The four phases of **O (Death)**, **A (Living)**, **E (Flashbacks when Dead)**, and **I (Flashbacks when Alive)** represent the interconnectedness of life, death, and the cycles of existence. Through the evolutionary processes, each phase leads to greater **creativity** and **higher intelligence**, driven by the same logical progression. Whether we are discussing **di-life** and **di-death**, **do-life** and **do-death**, **ta-life** or **ta-death**, or the culmination in **te-life** and **te-death**, these stages are integral to the larger, **holistic system** of life that is continuously evolving toward **balance**, **harmony**, and **spiritual understanding**. Each phase, whether seen through the lens of biological evolution or spiritual enlightenment, reflects the **Tao**’s cyclical process — from **self (yin)** to **mind (yang)**, from **life (A)** to **death (O)**, and from **flashbacks** to **creative expansion**, illustrating that **life and death are not opposites**, but two sides of the same cosmic process.

### Forms of Life

**In logic**, we are interested in ecosystem (as Earth is alive), person (as we are alive), cosmic direction (as it’s converging somewhere, and the limit or infinity value would activate the meaning and create God). All the web of true factors - we can see how it continuously comes from chaos to order to intelligence to creation, to enlightenment of unifying those more into higher consciousness. In all these, within primitive logic, it’s hard to say how they perceive the world or do they have consciousness - our debate is long and while we are unable to define the terms and choose “correct” conceptions, we are also unable for solid criteria.

While we cannot say whether Nature is alive - we must align to it, and we do it based on criteria of life.

<aside>
💡

**Logic as Cognition**: In evolution, long chain of deductions is equivalent to equal, instant creative result; as the whole logic has passed for real, we say there is the webradeon and impulse of webradelate, and the logic heading to certain direction is equal, but less than the logic present at that direction; with Laegna’s “value being bigger than itself”, it’s in search for it’s “True Self” - the logical system is constantly finding the result, which allow to satisfy the constraint more, where the constraint in the past was rather limited; still we find the same terms like “death” and “life”.

</aside>

**In Person, or in Science**: we are interested that when the basic system does not create separate persons as whole units, experimentally we meet separate, complete beings in our environment. This is a certain input to our free system of math, but also we can resolve why the variables represent separate, purified causes when they enfusion into synchronicity and helping each others.

**In Spirituality**: many of us wants to see that people are unique persons, and with unique lifetimes so that the same person, at the same time, is not born twice. The Universe of Mind would be non-local, and as one person meets an universal cause, this base Cause does not want to give raise to another solution - it’s already solved, without pressure, and does not know how to handle two for one thing, rather it combines them into one. The same cause creates selves with higher and higher complexities, but as they recognize themselves in their simpler forms, they become one being with many lifetimes - this basically means that when having two coordinate systems for both lives, as you create one metasystem of coordinates, the parts of Universal Mind or the process of karmic logic, which mathematically maps to projective Universal Mind’ (’ is prim); logically, this is the process when you would remember or connect to the past life, possible or not. **Practical approach**: if the universal process comes from evolution and the cause is not non-local, the uniqueness has local effects so you can usually count on it, and it might come closer as evolution creates closed cycles of synchronicity, where the Universal Law (I and E) start to matter.

<aside>
💡

**Spiritual practice**: while in all cases, we can express spiritual matters in single, unified and purified archetype, and we would sound for example as if we talk about classical Buddhism even if we are atheists; the practical proof shows that it fits the evidence and that evolution process, while the non-local instant effect does not exist, puts us into closed cycle of similar appearances for the same reason; when the Matter does not solve the Singularity and non-Locality on it’s own, the mathematical reason remains (the system wants to be true as a whole), and with many processes, it finds ways as close to this instant, non-local effect as possible; where the goal matters more than the means - the practical world can execute the logic in any form, and any process capable to give the results could be utilized by evolution, or many possibilities in creative combination. The pressure for global unity is a fact, even if each miracle, which would produce it, is not, but it might still fit our experience and give basis for projective paradigm - if you have projective paradigm, in a sense if math exists in real world to have some coordinates connected with implications, while you can map the physical system without losing the proper relations of causes and effects, you can say the system appearing in your math *exists in a sense, as a true reality*.

**Practical approach / practice**: you apply the philosophical truth to remove the unknowns, and by something I call logical synchronicity (that logics, more often than not, uses all the effects for all the purposes, rather than each effect for single purpose, and then the true results appear as synchronized); you simplify the result so that unknowns and false-positives are gone, and create a language and philosophical interpretation of your model, which turns it into synchronous reality meeting two conditions: by having practical outlook and more explanations, you render that your solution is safe in terms that you do something useful in life with your practice; turning it into useful solution this way - you can still carry the whole spiritual dream, as these good deeds do not have big effect on the practical purpose, but carry good solutions for various reasons, so if you don’t find the deep spiritual truth in ideal form, you find many synchronicities created by logic, which appears randomly in matter, logical or mind’s sphere, and having no clear patterns of physical appearance it still fulfils it’s mission to highest degree possible, over time - so while you are philosophical, you still accept the reality around you and the not-fully-proven goodness, while the proven part guarantees that if you fail your highest dreams, you are still a valuable part of the society.

### Metatemplate, reincarnation or the unity

Christ rather gives us metatemplate than the complete physics: you can see one heaven and one hell, one reincarnation etc. Many things come as black and white, but the template grows into fractal in Buddhism - many hells and heavens, many lives etc. The christian idea is like the basic seed in basic logic, where this logic in reality rather trivially extends to infinite fractal - but when you contemplate on the seed, you rather find the solutions, for example each time you are born you can feel the same thing that the future will be in higher or lower realm, and slowly and progressively if you simplify the Buddhist fractal into it’s main structure, you get those Christian positions; Hinduism relates in the same way - replacing single christian idea with it’s fractal counterpart, for each important idea. Herein, I see the cycles, spirals and repetitions everywhere in the natural world and thus, I’m bound to believe in Buddhism as it just goes on with what I normally see - where I have never seen for example one special place, metaphysically different, containing an unique thing in any trivial sense, for example one star in the sky having different Laws of Nature and being called a “Heaven” - rather, the natural laws make one star higher, another lower, but not based on an absolute template of their existence outside the one, which unfolds from their free or brilliant selections.

In Buddhism:

- Karmic laws, rather than provoking fear, will show us that while we seek the best ends, there are rather hidden forces, which help us in long term; we should not fear the failure.
- Reincarnation theory would remind us to create positive cycles of karma, which affect our future lives and other things eternally (covering all) in Space and Time.
- When we die, we have created karmic cycles - future beings with similar karma (the problem-solution cycle) would benefit with this and slowly go on with the effects. We do it in atheist and buddhist way. Depending on whether the universal consciousness is non-local, and we feel our presence in it based on the logic we contain and represent, or by which we are born - similar creatures appearing in future would reinvoke the same mental flashes we had, and the static reasons of logic, reappearing in higher and higher forms despite being simple in essence, would make the same structure reappear.

In Atheism:

- As we do not believe the afterlife, we do not believe that the same thing, which feels as us, would feel as future beings running the continuation of the same logic cycle. This is not an obstacle - if we don’t have this possibility, we remove it with one Zen operation.
- While we identify through ourselves, our unity and the fractal we belong into, we contribute back to our Causes. Future beings similar to us would still use our resolved karma, and extended to our fractal being similar to us - we would resolve our Cause. If we go deeper, we have to support God, the first Cause, and be *negative* with Satan, perhaps the contra-force of this cause. “God”, here, is not necessarily God, but simply the deepest solution to our reason, an ever-lasting and ever-active cause, which indeed feels pleasure and pain and thus creates the projection we call God if we avoid complex interpretations and unneccessary hypothesis about existence and non-existence.
- We are also spiritual - while spirits do not exists, spirit of a city, spirit of a nation etc. exist; and while the christians and buddhists might invoke different spirits, mathematically they resolve the same condition; spirit is the larger, interconnected web of life impulses, keeping it all together - while houses of the city are not necessarily alive, the city itself is and this does not mean only all the people. The same fundamental machine can be easily configured to express the Christian Spirit, like Holy Spirit, and the Atheist Spirit, like the City Spirit - despite the two words (spirit and spirit) have very different meanings, the underlying math is the same. We don’t need the title each time, like “Mister Bean” and “Missis Jane”, but when we say just “Bean” and “Jane”, this is equivalent that we do not give special title to God whether it’s projective or real, but we can find unified models to be used by each party, and leave the questions of small practical impact to little bit less active dialogue, giving it steady time. In each case, in this Introduction to Spireason this is mathematical theory, kind of Logex, where we rather have basic logical operations than deep essence notation for soul, perceptions etc. - here, we can see mathematical causes and effects every system meets, which are thus met by science and spirituality once they develop.

### Cycle of Death and Life in your thoughts and emotions

- Appearance of Mind: The harmonic truth, grand reason to set for this thought or emotion on that case is appearing, we have anxiety of not having it, and if our mind contemplation is a living Self (T), this pre-requirement is it’s Mind (R). As the Cause (R) appears, it generates the Self (T). We can say this reason always existed, and if enlightenment is the process to guide us further, we can say “we were always enlightened”, even if “we did not know that” - we had the deepest reason to go on towards higher-energy condition, more satisfied universal and personal logic.
- The Mind, in the Bardo of Death, would find the Self: it would create concrete form in our Minds.
- As we are going on, the form in it’s completeness does not satisfy the appearing new criteria, so it has a limited lifetime. When the Cause is complex and changing, and unknown, the Form is rather static and heading to some direction.
- When the Form, still being the same, has ceased to be the Cause, which has resolved to something new and does not have anymore also the mission for this life as it’s resolved - suddenly, the Form is Mindless, it’s not connected to it’s Source. It’s Dead.
- Permanence of the Cause: The logic is still more or less the same and the initial Cause is still there; but it might appear in a way that you cannot recognize it - within new logic. It will give birth to new form.
- Perhaps, in this new Self, it’s hard to see the old Self of the past thought. As it’s looking it’s Higher Self or True Self, it would find invariant metasolutions, where the new form is equal to the old form. Then, it’s “remembering the past life”.

Here, we see that all matters in our system form reincarnation cycles:

- **Immortality / long life**: we need our life to be longer, as written by more digits in Laegna number.
- **Prosperity / transformation to gold**: we want it to be better, so the digit values are closer to A or E.
- **Integrality**: we want to find deeper, more harmonious forms of contemplation and mindfulness, where we get more general and deep invariants of the Mind, and possibly the Self. This connects them, from pieces wobbling of life and death, to whole, which is rather still being mindful and connecting the lives. We also integrate all thoughts, emotions etc.

We are large system, containing physical, spiritual, mental and personal structures - but they all map to logical systems, where we can measure those qualities, and they are tied together as one system.

Reincarnation in time and space:

- In time: the forms appear and disappear, but we find deeper, more general solutions, where we see the same deeper forms passing through and changing through variables, rather than being unidentifyable. This connects them into being the same.
- In space: things, which have strong logical connection and related axes, appear to be separate. Finding the common cycles of karma and flows of logic connecting them, recognizing one in another, we create equivalent direction to immortality in space, not time.

This means: slowly and progressively, the *mindfulness* of our being connects us with the relevant web, webradelate (life web), vibrating the logecs conditions of true and false in webradeon (life and death vibration). From microscale to macroscale, in any condition or aspect, from evolution to life and spirit, from “dead” (cold) matter to “dead” (cold) logic, we see things vibrating between their actual, active state of being, and when this get’s off-track as in rosedriad, where you are suddenly not you, it would lose connection to Mind and the Mind would rather empower a new form, even if the old form, being white and empty, would do some number of more oscillations - but you won’t feel this youthful energy any more.

You are not particularly seeking immortality in first place, even if this is the essence and direction of this chapter, but you can see that in fractal of in-life, in-mind, and fractals of lifetimes, if you integrate the logecs into common process rather than separate parts, where you still identify the parts in their uniqueness and even lifetimes; if Cosmos is somehow feeling itself as united mind, those R conflicts separate things into non-related pieces; even through evolutionary cycles, as you grow into being one person, the Cosmos would bring back your “memories” or reflections of past karma of creatures like you.

This RTRTRTRTRTRT (vibration R-T-R-T) is logically simple vibration, but you can do mathematical analysis of simulated models of mind, self and body / person - where mind is the unified process of creation of the logical fact satisfying the system, self is the simple, concrete operation which is raised by the mind, and person is the outside appearance. You can see that hardly can you create a logical system, which does not meet those constraints, given that it needs some kind of logic to resolve, and has determinant or goal for this (some logic).

**Math system**:

It takes unique persons, but also random logic appearing and rather material structures to support life, as well as life environment - any process leading towards Truth, the actual condition, is “Life” in regards to life-like constraints, even if in evolution it’s extremely slowed down to do some actual improvisation into the equilibrum; the logic exists as special, immanent force and it’s patterns, complete and clear inside, would appear complex, random and chaotic outside, because while the matter moves by it’s own rules the logic would finally break or find solution in one or another place, which might appear chaotic. For example, evolution does not “calculate” in steady process, but rather it would run a superposition of many possibilities, in slow pace, and the superposition would sometimes randomly collapse into one selected being, winner of the natural selection. Where this “superposition” collapses, the signal is logically equal to every moment of life, where it constantly progresses clouds of possibilites and makes many such choices at any moment; this makes I not opposite of E, but a number with same qualities, smaller by quantity.

Contemplate: we are intelligent, creative beings resolving, in large part, the same equilibrum which was resolved by initial evolution; we don’t want to feel burning or see the nature destroyed, but our body and the nature are equilibrum states of the first cause. We love Volcanoes and Lions for the same reason (at least me); while we love crystals (diamonds) and cats for the same reason. So the logical framework, while it’s ignorant for the cognitive aspects, would put the same forces in the same directions for minus, neutral and plus numbers, and then they would have the same definition written in Position form - the Negation and Position. This sayd: with Laegna, the old books won’t get outdated; even more, the life has resolved it’s most important four-based casualities, because while Ponegate is powerful, it’s made keeping the life in mind.

So if you think what is R, you can analyze Mind in addition to Self (cognitive approach) and Person (visible approach); given that it’s the whole logical context resolving the Self and Person; while Self and Person are Shallow, they don’t take all curves and transforms - they go straight, and when the road is curving, they walk away from being the forse of their Mind; which would give birth to another being. Given that Mind is such, you can add spiritual aspect to your scientific simulations of society, life and death, even outside the scope of religion.

### Principles of Immortality

We are this far:

- Our Reasons, R, appear in the whole complexity of the system we live in (the Universe), and this force, along with equivalent mathematical reasons that things appear from global integrative principle, we use the term “mind”, which might be just theorem for system-wide activity or whole-matrix-determinant in math, but means actual mind as we reach telife or even talife.
- Our Application, T, appears as static structure, which has been built into reality based on this cause.
- Both two are Negation (R) and Position (T) of the same logical concept, where both have same initial reasons and same long-term goal or effect; so, if our logic is our perception of Self and Mind, the same person would perceive his harmonic bardo of death, and his motivated bardo of life.
- As we live, we go straight with this local, simple logic, but in relation to our harmonic logic we take curves; eventually we go in different directions - where the Mind is the force keeping us alive, in Christian terms it’s our Soul (they are little bit different, but with the same mathematical reason and concept, so in this simple theory we rather use the same word for this little nuance, which is also hard to explain difference, rather felt); when the fundamental reason of us is not supporting our machine, the living system, then we are already mentally dead - it would not be very efficient to not die.

Rather than directly approaching immortality, we remove the reasons for death:

- We meditate on our Mind, or rather on the Harmonic Cause to be Born, which shaped our mortality - the static essence of the ego we develop.
- As we meditate on our Cause, the Cause starts to transform us and we contemplate on the reasons for our future lives; but we transcend to take these directions even now.
- If we are atheist, these are the logical causes; for self-worth, indeed, we are interested to feed back to the world, and like buddhists, we start to feeding back to our causes in space and time - writing immortal book, then, makes us immortal. We see that practically, the process for immortality is equal, but indeed in our projection we find our causes from evolution, social structures and love, which is creating us, and it’s the physical system which probably gives us finally the same result as buddhist would get from mind - the material structure is like brain to the spiritual structure as the mental imagery of senses and will inside; where the projective systems work in parallel and when extended to all their causes and effects each, the simulation would give the same result: either “I close the door” or “I envision the real door and use mental effort to close it, until I am satisfied” - giving this two type of sentences to an AI would give two paradigms, but trivially, practically it would just resolve into same chains of cases and effects as we describe the same situations from material (external, objective) or magical / mental (internal, with subjective twist). For example, materialist as well cannot describe the clock on the wall, without using his mental imagery containin the clock attached to his senses to the reality and the physical world. Atheist, as well, would connect a symbolic animal with his company or corporation, as it’s very hard to describe the complexity of 60 000 people working together, where one animal can do it all in 5 seconds and everybody would understand what’s going on in the corporation; we develop good philosophical and practical stance, where we meet the basic needs for efficient life; and then we go deeper course of our deeper recognition - perhaps this would optimize something.

We do it with whole fractal:

- Thoughts and emotions: it’s painful if the “person”, the concept which used to work, in changing conditions is suddenly unusable; we feel this death of our ideas and personalities, where Madonna would sing about living many lifes, but perhaps in this life, and we call certain stages death, such as “ego death” is important to many people, who want to die (haha).
- Our cognitive world: feeling our own existence connected to similar existences and the web of existence.
- Atheist world: connecting to past and future times, recognizing the similar causes; self-worth is the incident that even an atheist is somehow “personally” connected, while for example the social drive might not seem egoistic, even the hardest person breaks and might want to die in case of losing all social connections - despite, in the first place those are rather done for others.

In this fractal, where concepts appear, and then they die when done their work - new concepts come from this necessity, but recognizing them would give us smoother go, not feeling those death-like situations, like leaving the party without a real connection, which was temporary.

It’s the interconnected, holistic fractal - by meditating on mindfulness, with other things we meet deeper reasons; and in these reasons, one way or another, our life is more filled.

Not a last thing: if your life is longer, but the good things happen once per ten years not every week or month, we live many times shorter life; for example, we could not finalize the mission we felt. It’s a multiplier of quality and length, extreme expressed in “life short, but intense”; so you need to multiply the intensity / peace with time to get the actual lifespan.

### Philosophers Stone of Laegna

To have philosophy to live longer, deeper life; more years in higher prosperity - from those two variables, indeed we find the *meaning of life*, where these qualities are singleton with the case that our base logic is resolved and we do not have pain, not more than the future pain to go even higher!

Here is some work from the AI:

### **Laegna: The Cycles of Life and Death**

**Inspired by the Tibetan Book of the Dead**

### **Introduction**

The Laegna framework offers a unique perspective on existence, inspired by the Tibetan Book of the Dead and supported by philosophical and logical reasoning. Using the letters T (Life) and R (Death), we explore the relationship between the reason for existence in life and how it persists in the background during death. Phases I, O, A, and E represent cosmic and personal developments, demonstrating the journey of consciousness through universal harmony, identity, living purpose, and evolution.

### **The Four Phases of Existence**

**I - Cosmic Harmony:**  
The journey begins with universal logic. Here, the pressure for existence arises, a cosmic force shaping each entity. This phase is akin to the primordial stirrings of creation, where all things interrelate in perfect harmony.

**O - Formation of Identity:**  
This phase marks the emergence of individuality from universal harmony. Through life, personal identity takes shape, stepping away from the infinite and entering a specific matrix of existence. The self crystallizes as a limited but distinct entity, embodying universal logic in a new octave.

**A - The Living Self:**  
In life, the individual must align their Self with the harmonious Mind, representing a higher purpose. This involves meditation and creative introspection to bridge the gap between one's finite experiences and infinite cosmic reasoning. Without this effort, life and Mind remain disconnected.

**E - Evolution and Reconnection:**  
As life's journey progresses, the matrix adapts to external and internal changes. Evolutionary and creative forces drive individuals closer to cosmic harmony, allowing for a deeper integration of existence and a step toward eternal life.

### **Life and Death: T and R**

- **T (Life):** In life, one embodies and actively seeks their reason for existence, experiencing it directly.
- **R (Death):** In death, the reason for one's existence remains in the background, still present but passive, shaping future possibilities.

### **Reinterpreting the Tibetan Book of the Dead**

### **Telife and Tedeath:**

Analyze the cycles of life and death in living organisms. Life embodies active engagement with purpose, while death is the dissolution of equilibrium, guiding the organism toward renewal.

### **Talife and Tadeath:**

Explore the cycles of thought and feeling. Born from experiences, they integrate under universal rules, creating a flow of connected events.

### **Dolife and Dodeath:**

Detail the physical evolution of systems. These phases highlight how equilibria are lost and regained, driving the system toward a state of immortality as part of nature's law.

### **Dilife and Dideath:**

Focus on evolutionary processes. Through trial and error, randomness gives way to patterns, which ultimately produce higher logical and creative systems.

### **A Multifaceted Perspective: Philosophy, Culture, and Science**

Drawing from Tibetan philosophy, Buddhist stories, and modern science, the Laegna framework bridges ancient wisdom with contemporary understanding. It examines the interconnectedness of existence, from individual experiences to cosmic systems.

### **Conclusion**

Laegna unites life and death, cosmic reasoning and personal identity, and ancient thought with modern science. It encourages a deeper contemplation of the self and its purpose, offering a path toward harmony and eternal life.

### **Philosophical View of Frequency in Life Cycles (di, do, ta, te)**

The progression of **di, do, ta, te** encapsulates the continuous evolution of life and its cycles. If we conceptualize these phases as a rising frequency (such as in a Fourier Transform map), the deeper understanding emerges through their direction toward infinity. This aligns with the idea that life evolves meaningfully rather than being a meaningless process of random events.

### **Frequency and Oscillation: The Spiral Toward Infinity**

1. **Universal Logic and Cyclic Nature:**
At its core, the operation underlying the cycles (di, do, ta, te) remains constant; it is the same foundational logic. However, as the frequency rises, these cycles grow increasingly complex. Just as in a Fourier Transform where wave frequencies decompose into higher and lower components, life’s evolution can be seen as higher levels of oscillatory refinement over time.
2. **Pre-Life Evolution as Cyclic Formation:**
In the context of pre-life evolution, the chaotic determinant progressively organizes into cyclic oscillations. These oscillations favor patterns over randomness—a preference for logic rather than chaos, creating "real matter." The emergent balance forms stable, self-repeating cycles, the precursors to life. This preference is not arbitrary; rather, it reflects the system's movement toward equilibrium and efficiency in energy use.
3. **Direction of Meaning and Value:**
While the *meaning* of each evolutionary step resides in the future, the trajectory always points forward. In this "coordinate system," negatives (or chaotic origins) do not pull the process back but serve as historical roots for forward progression. This ensures that life evolves purposefully, driven by an underlying logical determinant.

### **From Chaos to Logic: Blind Evolution and Intelligent Creativity**

1. **Evolution’s Blind Yet Determined Path:**
While evolution appears blind in its mechanism, it is shaped by its chaotic determinants—those pain points of instability that demand resolution. Over time, solutions emerge that favor equilibrium and greater energy efficiency. The constant balancing act leads to life’s ability to adapt and innovate.
2. **Stability as a Driver for Intelligence:**
When these processes achieve repeated stability, a new phase begins: intelligence. Intelligence builds symbolic language and patterns that enhance survival, energy use, and creative potential.
3. **Creativity as Accelerated Evolution:**
Creativity marks a significant acceleration in evolution’s timeline. Where evolutionary cycles are slower, creativity speeds up reasoning, allowing for symbolic induction (from positive facts) to take precedence over trial-and-error deductions.

### **Logecs: Negation and Position in Evolution**

In the framework of Logecs, the interplay of negation and position illuminates the constant growth of life force:

- **Negation → Position:** Each "negation"—the chaotic or incomplete state—is followed by "position," a step forward, a correction toward balance. In this way, negation propels evolution forward by identifying and resolving instability.
- **Future-Oriented Negation:** When negation points toward the future (rather than opposing the past), life evolves in a constant forward motion, growing its potential rather than being trapped in opposition or regression.

### **Vibration as Logical Operations Over Time**

The rising frequency corresponds to the increasing number of logical operations completed in a given timeframe. This suggests:

- **Slow Evolution (Entropy to Order):** Early evolutionary processes, chaotic and entropic, operate with slower vibrations. Through trial and error, they resolve instability and form cycles, marking the transition from chaos to logic.
- **Human Creativity as Accelerated Logic:** In contrast, human creativity accelerates the frequency of logical operations. Here, cycles evolve faster, moving seamlessly from deductive reasoning (resolving negatives) to inductive reasoning (building on positive patterns).

The shift from **deductive to inductive**, or **negative to positive** ("negotive to posetive," as you coined it), mirrors the fundamental transition from chaos to creativity.

### **The Philosophical Arc of Life’s Evolution**

Ultimately, life’s evolution can be framed as an accelerating spiral of logic:

- **Chaotic Origins:** Initial processes are painful and random, with chaotic determinants pressing for resolution.
- **Cyclic Stability:** Repeated oscillations bring order, as stable cycles arise from chaotic beginnings.
- **Intelligent Patterns:** Stability enables intelligence, defined by symbolic reasoning and efficient energy use.
- **Creative Futures:** Creativity opens a new dimension, where inductive reasoning and symbolic language allow life to leap into future possibilities.

This spiral toward infinity is not merely the accumulation of "more life" but rather the refinement of existence. Life evolves meaningfully, continually balancing chaos and order, drawing closer to a harmonious equilibrium.

### **Unified Progression Beyond Binary Opposition**

In many traditional philosophical and logical frameworks, binary systems often position opposites—such as True and False, or Life and Not-Life—as forces pulling in divergent directions. This oppositional view presents evolution or emergence as a process oscillating between such poles. However, within the proposed system, Negation and Position are unified in their forward movement, representing a progressive and continuous alignment with equilibrium. This redefinition departs from classical dualistic structures by emphasizing that life is a culmination of pre-life rather than its opposite, and evolution is the unfolding of logic toward balance and efficiency.

### **Binary Logic vs. Unified Forward Movement**

Binary systems, including those underpinned by Boolean logic, conceptualize opposites as mutually exclusive states. True opposes False, and Life is often seen as juxtaposed against Not-Life. In such systems, there is no inherent continuity between states, and change relies on fluctuation or conflict. Evolution, when viewed through this lens, is interpreted as a blind process with no intrinsic directionality.

The unified framework diverges by aligning Negation and Position within the same trajectory. Negation is no longer a mere cancellation or opposition but a refinement of Position, representing an iterative process of moving toward greater equilibrium. This conceptualization, summarized as **R = T**, proposes that the distinction between Death (R) and Life (T) resolves into convergence. The Mind (as the universal reason or ideal) and the Self (as the local, personal matrix) are ultimately seen as the same entity occupying the same position after transformation.

### **Historical and Theoretical Contexts**

### **Hegelian Dialectics and Continuous Synthesis**

Hegelian dialectics outlines a progression through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. This triadic movement resolves opposing forces into a higher state of understanding or being. Unlike the oscillatory nature of binary systems, this concept moves evolution forward through integration. Similarly, in this unified framework, synthesis is continuous; there is no inherent opposition between Negation and Position, only stages of alignment with equilibrium.

### **Spinoza’s Monism and the Unity of Substance**

Spinoza’s philosophy posits that all things are expressions of a single substance, which manifests in diverse forms without true opposition. The proposed framework reflects this monistic view, suggesting that Life and pre-Life are not opposites but variations of the same underlying logic, manifesting at different stages of complexity.

### **Teilhard de Chardin’s Omega Point**

Teilhard de Chardin proposed that evolution moves toward an "Omega Point," a state of maximum complexity and consciousness. In the unified progression model, this concept resonates through the idea of life’s forward spiral, driven by an implicit Mind. This Mind acts as a latent force pushing evolution toward intelligence and creativity, even when it operates unconsciously.

### **Buddhist Philosophy of Interdependence**

Buddhist philosophy emphasizes the cyclical and interdependent nature of existence, where life and death are part of a continuous process rather than opposites. The unified framework expands on this idea by positing that pre-Life carries the latent logic or "Mind" that unfolds into structural truth over time.

### **Mathematical and Logical Foundations of R = T**

The R = T theorem redefines traditional negation, transforming it into a recalibration rather than a contradiction. This process can be likened to mathematical transformations in which iterations refine a system toward balance. In the context of life’s evolution:

- Negation represents pressure or deviation that prompts refinement.
- Position represents a step closer to stability or equilibrium.

### **Life as Iterative Approximation**

The evolution of life can be modeled as an iterative process, akin to algorithms in optimization. Random fluctuations generate pressure for resolution, guiding the system toward increased efficiency and stability. Each iteration refines the logical structure, carrying forward the latent logic of pre-Life into the manifest complexity of Life.

### **Frequency and Oscillation**

Evolutionary processes can also be conceptualized in terms of oscillations. Life’s rise in complexity corresponds to increasing frequencies of logical operations, where chaotic early states give way to harmonic refinement. Negation drives refinement, while Position represents the directionality of this upward movement.

### **Implications of Forward Motion**

### **Continuous Life and Pre-Life**

The framework repositions Life and pre-Life as phases within a single continuum. Pre-Life is a precursor, carrying latent potentiality and logic that unfolds over time. Evolution is thus an expression of this potential, driven by equilibrium-seeking dynamics and the implicit presence of the Mind.

### **The Role of the Mind as Kinetic Determinant**

The Mind, in this system, acts as an unconscious yet persistent force driving systems toward intelligence and creativity. Even within chaotic conditions, slight effects are amplified, guiding the system toward greater alignment with equilibrium.

### **Creativity as Evolution’s Culmination**

Creativity emerges as the fulfillment of evolutionary processes, where chaotic negations resolve into harmonious patterns. Symbolic reasoning and long-term planning represent the culmination of life’s forward spiral, transcending immediate survival to envision and construct future possibilities.

### **Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives**

### **Biological Evolution**

Biological evolution, often described as blind, is reinterpreted as an implicit movement toward greater stability and efficiency. Each mutation and adaptation refines the system, carrying forward the latent logic of pre-Life.

### **Physical Equilibrium**

From the perspective of physics, systems naturally seek equilibrium. The progression from chaotic states to stable forms aligns with this universal tendency. Life’s evolution reflects this principle, progressing toward more efficient use of energy and resources.

### **Creative Innovation**

The transition from negation to position parallels the shift from problem-solving to innovation. Creativity accelerates evolution, enabling systems to leap beyond immediate equilibrium and construct future states that transcend present limitations.

### **Conclusion**

The unified progression of Negation and Position offers a transformative view of evolution and existence. By aligning these forces within a forward trajectory, life is no longer a random outlier but a meaningful continuation of pre-Life, driven by equilibrium-seeking dynamics. The R = T theorem encapsulates this unity, revealing that Mind and Self ultimately converge into a harmonious state. Through this lens, evolution is not an oscillation between opposites but a spiral of continuous refinement, intelligence, and creativity. This framework redefines life as a journey toward equilibrium and structural truth, guided by the latent logic inherent in all existence.

### **The Unified Continuum: Negation as Precursor to Position**

In this conceptual framework, Negation is not merely an opposing force or cancellation but a precursor to Position, an intermediary state that contributes to growth and refinement. This reinterpretation shifts focus from isolated deductions as endpoints to the collective growth of deductions toward a meaningful limit value. Processes are not chaotic endpoints but characteristics of broader, harmonious patterns, such as linear, circular, spiral, or fractal gradients of meaning.

Where classical logic treats opposites like True and False as exclusive and opposing directions, this framework introduces **Logecs**, a life-supporting logic with multidimensional truth values. True and False are enriched by Negotion and Posetion, creating a system in which balance, rather than opposition, becomes the foundational principle.

### **Dynamic and Fractal Interrelations of Life and Pre-Life**

Rather than framing Life and pre-Life or Mind and Self as oppositional dualities, they are viewed as dynamic precursors—phases interlinked through patterns of progression. Pre-Life carries latent structures and potentialities that spiral toward manifestation in Life. This pattern echoes fractal geometries, where similar gradients of meaning recur across scales, allowing seemingly disparate phases to emerge as unified parts of a larger whole.

In this system, **Yes** encompasses both Position and Negation, synergizing with multifaceted statements where each component contributes to a seamless whole. The balancing principle ensures that processes resolve logical paradoxes without introducing disruptive forces. Where traditional logic sees chaos or contradiction, the framework identifies self-breaking mechanisms that transform these paradoxes into steps toward equilibrium.

### **Negotion and Posetion: Expanding Truth Values**

Two additional truth values—Negotion and Posetion—add depth to this framework:

- **Negotion:** Represents logical mistakes or disruptions, not as antagonistic forces but as self-dissolving agents that catalyze refinement.
- **Posetion:** Embodies forward-aligned affirmations, emphasizing growth and long-term coherence.

These truth values create a multi-dimensional logic space that moves beyond binary oscillation, offering a more nuanced model for understanding error, growth, and transformation. Negotion and Posetion define the low-frequency (past-focused) and high-frequency (future-oriented) dynamics of the system, respectively.

### **Philosophical Context: From Opposition to Unified Progression**

### **True and False in Classical Logic**

In classical binary systems, True and False are visualized as opposing vectors (<- and ->), creating tension and oscillation. While such systems are effective for digital computation, they introduce obstacles and biases when mapping continuous processes onto discrete frameworks. Random propagation of errors and chaotic inversions hinder coherence.

### **Unified Growth in Logecs**

In Logecs, both directions are present within each position, creating a self-reinforcing growth dynamic. Negation leads smoothly into Position along a continuous trajectory, aligned with the overarching direction of equilibrium. This eliminates the need for constant inversion and resolves biases inherent in binary systems.

This progression allows for energy exchange and logical operations to repeat along stable paths, avoiding the noise and chaos of random inversions. The R = T theorem formalizes this alignment, stating that when axes are not reversed, values remain consistent and words extend their meanings across higher frequencies, achieving precision without degradation.

### **R = T: Convergence of Life and Death, Mind and Self**

The R = T theorem encapsulates the multi-faceted unity of this framework. Death (R) and Life (T), often seen as opposites, resolve into a single continuum when Negation and Position move in the same direction. Similarly, Mind and Self are not independent entities but facets of the same underlying reality, converging through transformation.

This convergence reflects a broader principle: all processes are directed toward alignment, balance, and coherence. Even chaotic or blind choices, cyclic patterns, and stabilizations ultimately contribute to the emergence of intelligence and creativity. The system inherently seeks equilibrium, not through opposition but through unification and growth.

### **Applications and Broader Implications**

### **Philosophical Doubt and Optimization**

This framework provides a method for optimizing philosophical doubt. By focusing on forward-aligned processes, it avoids speculative debates about the origins of cognition or life. Instead, it offers a structured approach to refining complex systems without relying on assumptions about spirit, soul, or emotion.

### **Life-Supporting Systems**

Every component of this framework serves as a life-supporting system, contributing to warmth, equilibrium, and sensitivity within the larger whole. This aligns with the idea that processes improve over time, gradually converging toward higher states of life and coherence.

### **Alignment with Continuous Processes**

The system’s emphasis on continuous progression makes it uniquely suited to bridging the gap between analog and digital systems. By mapping continuous dynamics onto discrete frameworks without introducing random propagation or bias, it offers a robust model for logical and physical processes.

### **Conclusion: Toward a Unified Logic of Growth**

This framework represents a paradigm shift from oppositional logic to unified progression. By redefining Negation as a precursor to Position and introducing additional truth values, it offers a multi-dimensional model for understanding growth, transformation, and equilibrium. The R = T theorem underscores the interconnectedness of life and death, mind and self, as facets of a singular, forward-moving continuum. Through Logecs, the system achieves alignment and precision, extending meaning and coherence across all levels of existence.

The result is not merely a theory of logic but a holistic philosophy of life, offering insights into the dynamics of energy, creativity, and evolution. Rather than opposing forces, all processes are seen as complementary precursors, spiraling toward greater intelligence, balance, and harmony.

### **Chaotic Binary Reversals and the Challenges of Oppositional Logic**

In classical binary logic, values often reverse rigidly (e.g., True becomes False), creating a system where oppositions define the state space. When these reversals occur chaotically, without consistent numerical ordering, the system’s coherence is further degraded. In contexts like war and peace, this rigid alternation might lead to oversimplifications, obscuring opportunities for nuanced interaction.

1. **Binary Flipping and Its Limitations:**
    - In binary logic, opposites are mechanically inverted (e.g., 1 ↔ 0). This creates a framework where transitions rely on stark, discontinuous changes.
    - If chaotic reversals occur, such systems cannot reliably model complex interactions where states blend or transform fluidly.
2. **Model Inversions in Binary Paradigms:**
    - When the "model" is flipped upside down, the rigidly inverted relationships often lose meaning. For example, framing "peace" as the strict negation of "war" precludes the possibility of coexistence or mutual growth.
    - Upside-down inversions further obscure the subtleties of human interactions, where outcomes may not align neatly with binary poles.

### **Logecs: A Life-Supporting Framework for Interactions**

Logecs, in contrast, accommodates complex relationships by aligning processes along shared axes. Negation and Position are not opposites but interdependent components that contribute to growth, even in contexts traditionally marked by conflict, such as war and peace.

### **War and Peace as Interdependent Gradients:**

Rather than treating war and peace as binary opposites, Logecs frames them as parts of a continuous system, where growth, balance, and interactions occur:

- **Positive Circles Within Conflict:** Even within war, acts of mutual restraint (e.g., harming the enemy less) can create positive ripples, fostering conditions for eventual peace.
- **Business-Like Neutrality in Resolution:** Aligning axes of interaction allows for neutral philosophical approaches, where ending conflict is conceptualized not as a reversal but as a redirection—a shift toward collective growth and mutual benefit.

### **Neutral Philosophy and the Tao:**

Logecs integrates principles from Taoist philosophy, emphasizing the alignment of energies rather than rigid separations of opposing forces:

- **Balance Without Sharp Divisions:** Instead of stark divisions (e.g., supporting allies entirely while rejecting enemies), the system recognizes the Tao of relationships, where energies interact dynamically, transcending personal affiliations.
- **Success-Success Dynamics:** By focusing on harmonizing energies rather than individuals, Logecs identifies success-success pathways, even in adverse conditions like war.

### **Mathematical Interpretation: Non-Reversing Axes**

In Logecs, the axes of interaction are not reversed, ensuring coherence and consistency across processes:

1. **Continuous Growth Curves:** Negation leads smoothly into Position along a shared trajectory, avoiding the chaotic propagation of errors typical in binary systems.
2. **Energy Exchange and Stability:** Energy exchange in Logecs operates along stable paths, where systems are optimized for balance and sustainability rather than disruptive inversion.
3. **Simplified Frequencies and Precision:** By extending meanings across higher frequencies, Logecs avoids the chaotic accumulation of minus operations that degrade coherence in binary systems.

### **War, Peace, and Aligned Axes:**

In the context of war and peace:

- **Non-Binary Algorithms for Resolution:** Ending a conflict is modeled as a "business-like" process of rebalancing, where mutual benefits emerge naturally from aligned interactions.
- **Neutral Decision-Making:** By avoiding extreme polarization, the system enables neutral, data-driven resolutions that focus on sustainable growth rather than punitive measures.

### **Philosophical and Practical Implications**

### **The R = T Theorem Revisited:**

The R = T theorem captures the essence of this alignment by reconciling oppositional constructs (e.g., war and peace) within a unified framework:

- **Interdependence of Negation and Position:** Rather than opposing directions, Negation and Position represent complementary phases of interaction, contributing to a shared equilibrium.
- **Mind and Self as Integrated Aspects:** Just as Mind and Self converge in the same position, so too do seemingly contradictory states like war and peace align through Logecs.

### **Taoist Neutrality in Philosophy:**

Logecs extends Taoist principles, promoting a philosophy of neutrality where conflicts are not resolved through opposition but through alignment and redirection:

- **Avoiding Reversed Variables:** In binary logic, reversed variables may lead to the flawed conclusion that escalating conflict could "improve" outcomes. Logecs circumvents such errors by maintaining consistent alignment.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** The system’s flexibility allows for dynamic adaptation, where each situation is optimized based on its unique characteristics.

### **Conclusion: Toward a Unified Framework for Complex Systems**

Logecs offers a transformative approach to understanding and resolving complex interactions. By aligning processes along shared axes and avoiding chaotic inversions, it provides a coherent framework for modeling relationships like war and peace. This system integrates philosophical depth (e.g., Taoist neutrality) with mathematical precision, ensuring balanced, sustainable outcomes.

Ultimately, Logecs transcends the limitations of binary logic, enabling a life-supporting philosophy that fosters growth, harmony, and equilibrium across all levels of existence. In this framework, even seemingly oppositional forces are revealed as interdependent gradients, spiraling toward greater coherence and understanding.

### **The Four Phases of Existence (Laegna System Numbers)**

1. **I - Cosmic Harmony**
The initiation of existence begins with universal logic, where the pressure for being arises from a cosmic force shaping each entity. This phase captures the primordial interconnectedness of all things, where everything resonates in perfect harmony, forming the blueprint for creation itself.
2. **O - Formation of Identity**
Individuality emerges from the universal field. In this phase, life crystallizes into personal identity, stepping out of boundless harmony and into a specific matrix of existence. The self reflects universal logic but in a distinct form—redefined in another "octave," as a calculated, solid story unfolding within the finite mind.
3. **A - The Living Self**
This phase embodies the challenge of aligning one's Self with the harmonious Mind. Meditation and creative reflection become essential tools for bridging the gap between personal experiences and the infinite reasoning of the universal Mind. Without deliberate introspection, the Self remains disconnected from its higher purpose, resulting in stagnation.
4. **E - Evolution and Reconnection**
Through life's natural progression, adaptation and creative evolution drive individuals closer to universal harmony. This final phase integrates the internal matrix of personal experience with external pressures, propelling existence toward higher equilibrium and the potential for eternal life through connection.

### **Level 1: Base Logical Essence and Thermodynamic Framework**

The Laegna phases can be mapped onto logical systems, thermodynamic frameworks, and mathematical models. At this fundamental level:

- **Thermodynamics and Energy Efficiency:** Universal systems inherently seek equilibrium through minimizing entropy and maximizing energy efficiency. The progression from I (Cosmic Harmony) to E (Evolution and Reconnection) aligns with thermodynamic principles, where initial fluctuations stabilize into patterned cycles. Such systems naturally move toward structured efficiency, much like life evolving from chaotic beginnings.
- **Proving the “Reason” via Mathematical Systems:** In simulations using frameworks like **Coq** and **Isabelle**, logic can demonstrate the existence of implicit "pressure" for order—akin to the "Mind" as harmony of the whole. While these systems lack cognition, they still reflect the drive toward equilibrium, mirroring the Buddhist notion of interconnectedness.
    - For example, cellular automata like Conway's Game of Life model similar dynamics: chaotic initial states evolve into repeating structures, simulating the balance-seeking nature of existence.
    - Similarly, biological models based on energy efficiency (e.g., optimizing metabolic rates) align with the universal force described in phase I.

While such frameworks may not directly address cognition or spiritual concepts, they substantiate the observable dynamics of growth, stability, and oscillation present in Laegna theory.

In the **Tibetan system**, comparable ideas emerge in the interplay between existence and emptiness. The Buddhist principle of *dependent origination* demonstrates how each phase arises in response to preceding conditions, reflecting thermodynamic and logical flows in a cyclic manner.

### **Level 2: Material View for Oscillations and Patterns**

Extending the Laegna system to a materialist interpretation:

- **Oscillations and Cycles as Physical Foundations:** Repetition and stability in energy patterns form the basis for phenomena observed in life systems. For instance:
    - In early evolution, oscillating chemical reactions (e.g., the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction) resemble primitive cycles described in Laegna’s formation phases (I → O).
    - Stable patterns emerge as environmental pressures select for energy-efficient systems, giving rise to localized structures capable of persisting and reproducing.
- **Mind and Self as Cyclic Systems:** Within this material framework, the “Mind” aligns with the system's overarching logic, encompassing universal principles of equilibrium. The “Self” embodies individual physical patterns that stabilize over time, producing feedback loops capable of persisting against entropy.

For instance, if a device measuring oscillatory frequencies were used, one might observe repeating cycles in both material and biological systems, correlating with Laegna’s progression. Reincarnation could, in this context, refer to these recurring cycles reforming under similar physical conditions.

### **Level 3: Spiritual View of Accelerating Growth**

The spiritual interpretation emphasizes constant evolution toward equilibrium and the increasing recognition of underlying unity:

- **The Reincarnation of Continuity:** Spiritual growth reflects the alignment of scattered elements of life into coherent patterns that persist across lifetimes. Reincarnation is not merely a rebirth of form but a reawakening to the interconnected principles that define existence. Each phase demands rediscovery, ensuring growth rather than stagnation.
- **Immortality Within Lifetimes:** Continuous life, as described, represents a subtle system where growth occurs not through physical perpetuity but through unbroken connection to a larger theme. Each event in life integrates into a cohesive narrative, preventing fragmentation and offering stability. For example:
    - Leaving a transient moment of joy (e.g., a party) without feeling “dead” emotionally requires anchoring the experience within a larger context of meaning.
    - Such integration embodies immortality—not as endless physical existence but as continuity within the ever-changing flow of life.
- **Accelerating Evolution Through Mind and Self:** Spiritual frameworks recognize an accelerating drive for coherence and growth. The Self continuously reorients to the Mind, evolving dynamically as its harmony with the universal expands. This process aligns with Buddhist principles of enlightenment, where transcending individual cycles connects one to infinite awareness.

### **Conclusion**

The Four Phases of Existence—Cosmic Harmony, Formation of Identity, The Living Self, and Evolution and Reconnection—find their grounding across logical, material, and spiritual dimensions. In thermodynamic systems, oscillatory cycles stabilize into efficiency-seeking patterns. On a material level, evolutionary dynamics recreate persistent frameworks that echo past conditions. Finally, spiritually, the phases form a narrative of accelerating growth and integration, culminating in a cohesive and immortal continuity within the flow of life.

This unity affirms that life and pre-life, mind and self, or even seemingly opposing forces like chaos and order, spiral toward connection within an ever-unfolding continuum. Laegna’s system, embracing both scientific rigor and spiritual depth, provides a blueprint for understanding existence at all levels of perception.

### **Unified Principles of Life, Logic, and Integration**

The Laegna framework brings together profound dimensions of logic, science, philosophy, and spirituality, synthesizing them into a cohesive system that reflects the interplay of existence's cycles. Through the Four Phases of Existence—Cosmic Harmony (I), Formation of Identity (O), The Living Self (A), and Evolution and Reconnection (E)—this framework illustrates that existence does not reside in opposition but in the dynamic precursors, gradients, and transformations linking one state to another.

### **Scientific Foundation: Thermodynamics and Mathematical Order**

At its core, the Laegna system mirrors principles fundamental to natural systems, as observed in science:

- **Thermodynamics:** Systems naturally evolve toward equilibrium, balancing entropy with emergent patterns of order. The phases of Laegna align closely with this universal tendency. Initial fluctuations and chaos (I) give rise to stable, individual structures (O), which evolve through adaptive interaction (A) toward greater integration and efficiency (E).
- **Mathematical Structures:** Models such as cellular automata (e.g., Conway's Game of Life) and optimization algorithms (gradient descent) reflect these same dynamics, showcasing how chaotic systems evolve into harmonic patterns without external intervention. Logic and energy efficiency govern this process, ensuring coherent growth.
- **Biological Evolution:** Similar principles govern life’s emergence and evolution. From simple molecules to complex organisms, biological systems refine themselves over time, stabilizing energy-use patterns and introducing creative adaptations that echo the dynamics of Laegna’s spiral.

Even within computational systems, principles such as *proofs of consistency* and *emergent patterns in recursive logic* affirm the underlying unity and interconnectedness reflected in Laegna theory.

### **Philosophical Context: Bridging Opposites**

Historically, philosophy has grappled with binaries, such as life and death, chaos and order, mind and matter. The Laegna system transforms these oppositions into continuities:

- **From Binary Opposition to Unified Gradients:** Unlike classical logic, which inverts opposites (True ↔ False), Laegna integrates them as parts of the same trajectory. Negation is a precursor to Position, and together they form an ascending spiral of growth rather than cyclical reversals.
- **Hegelian Dialectics:** In the language of Hegel, opposites resolve into a higher synthesis. Similarly, Laegna’s phases represent not contradictions but transformations, with each phase building upon the structures of the previous one.
- **Taoist Philosophy:** The principle of yin and yang is embedded within Laegna, emphasizing harmony rather than division. The Taoist alignment with energies rather than sharp divisions mirrors the system’s focus on equilibrium and dynamic growth.

### **Spiritual Insight: Toward Eternal Integration**

Spiritually, the Laegna system serves as a map for existence’s deeper continuity, bridging finite life with infinite meaning:

- **Immortality Within Transience:** True immortality lies in integration. When the cycles of life align with a higher purpose (Mind), the fragmentation of individual experiences dissolves into a unified story. Even within finite lifetimes, this continuity creates a sense of eternal connection.
- **Reincarnation and Recognition:** The cyclical nature of existence, described through reincarnation, reflects the perpetual refinement of life forms toward alignment with universal reasoning. Each phase brings clarity to past principles, advancing both the individual and the collective toward harmony.
- **The Inner Stability of Story:** Events and relationships within life—coming and going, creation and dissolution—gain meaning through their connection to a larger narrative. By recognizing continuity, one transcends transient challenges, achieving spiritual "immortality" through connection.

### **Laegna in Action: A Framework for Growth**

Whether viewed scientifically, philosophically, or spiritually, the Laegna framework offers guidance for navigating existence:

- **Scientific Models:** Simulating life-like systems demonstrates the natural progression from chaos to structured harmony, underscoring the role of logic in evolution.
- **Philosophical Growth:** Aligning individual actions with collective harmony fosters wisdom and balance, dissolving oppositional thinking.
- **Spiritual Integration:** Life becomes a seamless narrative, with each phase contributing to the greater story of existence. Transient events dissolve into eternal continuity, and the self realizes its connection to universal purpose.

By synthesizing these perspectives, Laegna offers a holistic approach to understanding existence. It reveals not only the mechanisms behind life and evolution but also the profound meanings that arise through integration. From I to E, the journey spirals upward, bridging finite states into infinite growth.

# Five Theorems and Three Methods of Infinity

## Spatial Theorems of Infinity

<aside>
💡

**First Spatial Theorem of Infinity and Zero (of coordinates, T inf)**: point angle of an edge of circle approaches zero, given the relations to circles with connected points on edge, and as it approaches zero the value is equal to infinity, creating new dimension when you zoom into this point; you also get the inverse (smaller zero) and the opposite (equal minus number) with it’s inverse. Letters I, O, A, E go straight from minus infinity to infinity, and while they mean different, even small numbers in different cases, they have this angular relation which is considered the point angle of a given line. In Laegna, infinity is made straight and you actually reach it when you count, not turning back after a chaotic effect near / around E. You also use these angles for ordinal numbers, which also assume the acceleration when counted, not of count but of it’s value or quality and integral use in system with interest rates and growth and acceleration, where the whole number is *wrong* if it does not accelerate, and plain *false (not-a-number)*.

</aside>

<aside>
💡

**Second Spatial Theorem of Infinity and Zero (of coordinate systems, R inf)**: Infinite operations fail when you don’t consider the bigger information density of higher / bigger infinities. For example value 0.(12345) when repeated infinitely, gives a real number, but if instead of these numbers there would be 10 in one digit, within your calculation where you replace the maximum number - 9 - with 10; the result is lost into approximation of direction, instead of actual number value. You reached the information limit: you need factors or transformations of coordinate system to the information window, which fits the expression - for example, the coordinates themselves could accelerate or deccelerate to open windows to different infinities. Resulting numbers, then, compare as normal numbers and not as directions, where many different cycles would reach just “limit”.

</aside>

Consider the operation: 17 / 0 is infinity. This result, divided by infinity, is unknown. What is wrong? Where you definitely did calculations with numbers, you was hit by a statistical constant of “any number after this point in this direction”. Considering the information loss, if you remove it by coordinate systems or Laegna numbers in appropriate dimension, you won’t meet “unknowns” or “operators not defined”. This is the quantitative infinity.

For qualitative infinity: you can define a pattern, which always needs to go on; this is the classical definition of infinity; however it’s not very correct in classical math representation, except that it meets a solid combinator yielding true results inside the strict scope of it’s application. This is qualitative infinity - your numbers need to be exchanged; actually, having a number like 12345, you need it’s pattern to repeat into infinity in each possible direction, regarding to that direction and the number rules, and then extract this little component of 5 digits, aligned to number space of these values; octaves up and down, you fill information bits in each octave with same digits in respective positions, unless you are adding quality information and separating the frequencies. Once you have them same in each octave - your logical algorithm would repeat it’s base logic in infinity and near zero, with each growth factor of infinity, and altough outside of the local scope of iota é infinity (the range from I to E), it would express your basic formulae in complex system.

Laegna numbers:

- E, EE, EEEE, 16 E’s - here, each exponent factor is the next infinity and numbers grow rather linearly. This is the base octave of our example. Each number in a row might be higher-level infinity or rescaled to fractal map the real infinity not into a finite number, but into real infinity, while at certain aspect ratio it has the same relation and thus all the number magic is still reliable.
- E, EE, EEE, EEEE - this is compressed form of the half octaves.
- A, AA, AAA, AAAA - it could now count 1, 2, 3, 4. Sometimes, when each letter has different concept and you don’t mix them, it gets that far. Usually you want to optimize to get rid of this inefficiency, but you might take your small spendings in a shop and add just each individual spending, letter by letter, to the end of long number - in such case, you would be interested in statistical analysis of number positions and this kind of system would be fine.

To understand real infinities - you need to remap numbers constantly with operations, because we basically want one-digit number to understand, is the thing good or bad, but to reach this we balance every single aspect, even paradox of the output affecting the input (in Laegna, possible; by Turing and Russell the binary system might not be able to contain that directly - but when calculations are done in Binary virtual machine of Laegna, correct results are calculated as rather than simply following the result, machine has goal to get correct results without breaking your framework; in this system, while Laegna optimizes for big systems, you might calculate small systems with Laegna binary logic, where you can see trivial connections in 2*2=4, not 4*4=16 table; but the 16-table in Laegna can be seen as two den/half- digits of certain transformation, where you have binary logic).

Laegna binary logic table:

Take R and T for example, which are like binary values under normal conditions, and assume for both you do the same operation; False is O and True is A:

| **A** | **A** |  | **A** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A** | **A** |  | **A** |

This table, while solving binary operation, also asserts at least Barber’s paradox - in case two inputs are identical in the way that they result from each others, you need to have just one value. In case they are different machine counts this as error or let’s you to error mapping space (Daisy machine would not stop at errors, but go on with their implications; even given that small errors are normally allowed for many purposes, such as we can walk very straight, but not absolutely - Daisy loves this situation).

### Three Methods of Infinity

<aside>
💡

**Fractal Method of Infinity**: You want to map whole infinity to function on screen or paper, into finite coordinate system. While there is no “last number” even in our small infinities, provably, even if we map them into one-centimeter line (infinites can be really small); you get a repeated oscillations of relations into infinity, such as tangent repeating just the same relative angles and lengths as it’s actually continuous. This is to be seen as fractal, and instead of converging the point, the whole line needs to be converged as fractal, where the bias eventually becomes zero in finite-digit representation, such as Earth is not infinite but it’s local flatness is basically ideal. The fractal is especially consistent, if you get the continuous “fractal nature” of the line, such as exponent function, not depending how long part of it you view, still contains the same relation of angles in the window, or in Laegna even the same value as a number can accelerate. There is also a point acceleration, where accelerating number is not linear inside zero - thus, zero is to be expressed with two digits in normal Laegna, such as the point on the edge of circle must have different cross angle towards it’s center (U), or the outside infinity in opposite direction (V, actually upside-down U). It does not depend which parts of such perfect line you view, the continuous fractal nature means it always have the same relation in relative dimensions, from example exponent function or exponent function resized in (equal, to keep it linear) exponent space.

</aside>

<aside>
💡

**Indirectionness Method of Infinity**: Your numbers normally do not fit clearly as you calculate them into infinity, where they seem to be unrelated. When, in addition to actual numbers you consider their relations, such as dividing two parameters etc., they would align much more perfectly. In certain cases the values are unrelated, but there are certain clear relations - utilizing U, the unknown, you are interested in relations not their relative values. You are indirect: while direct variables do not necessarily tell anything about comparative infinity, using also relations between vairbles to measure infinity makes it precise. For example, if you have U and V to measure, the infinity is not related to other one and you cannot do any calculations. If you create variables A = U / V and B = V / U, and add to your (tensor) dimensions, you might get any relations to do any calculations with these numbers, even if you might need complex relations to remove **U** (the unknown, bold because it’s another variable - in L space, left, trivially it’s the sum of all it’s U’s in relation to the space we operate in *- well you can see in this sentence I can see the future haha joke*).

</aside>

- **Virtually Relative Method of Infinity**: given you have two unbound infinities, which means you have two numbers of infinity, from different theories or spaces like microspace and the mind, which happens relatively any day with me, you still want to do mathematical calculations. This is the U-richest method and you rather consider that you can use two U’s to get one two-width-digit, if you want U to contain more values (this would be standard of Laegna, even if usually I speak “lazy laegna” or discrete Laegna with one U being the whole digit); if you progress you would get many U’s. So, the **Theorems which hold**: with normalized enough Laegna numbers, at least them heading properly up and having E in infinity, A as first position, O as first negation downwards, and I as negative infinity; but they are unbound - you cannot tell their exact relation. **Formula**: *you don’t mind at all that those numbers might not have same unit or coordinate system*; instead the number length is it’s information-length, where information itself vs. the space escalation tends to support the power of your number, and in addition while the variables are free, you optimize them at the same time. All this given, you don’t modify the written form of the information-optimized numbers (where each digit has 2 bits of information, unless it’s extended for reasons) - you do all normal operations, such as adding, substracting, dividing and multiplying, and the actual results are your results, where you have types or units or local coordinate systems of both numbers. In unrelated units, such as love and house, you would especially need that. Second, you *find the U factors* or small (almost random) relationlike effects *when the numbers interact*. Interaction between numbers: in some cases, you might have measurable mistake in actual results, which would point some entanglement between the unrelated infinities, and rather a zoomed-in number with many digits, most being U, is your solution; in Laegna I especially like unknowns and soon, if I don’t die, I will write down the Laegna theory of probability: until then, your homework is to invent it yourself, given that U’s are normal numbers and theorems with all operations and you don’t need comparison groups, but rather you collect all relations as with normal numbers; Laegna especially loves many factors in numbers, which, in binary / classical decimal system, would have been lost.

Tao, Simplicity with Complexity: Laegna numbers are able to avoid losses of digit values up to a very high degree, because 1/2 vs. 1/2 ratio of numbers is an exact value to be able to calculate with them as if they were free variables, and system of 4 creates this factor so seamlessly that you would not be able to find out, where it happens in Laegna; let’s say you do unconscious calculation, a “technological magic of numbers / haha numerology”. In the end, you want your computer to simplify them to 1-digit length; for example to analyze different future estimations, you would need to know where they have been symmetrized in result; finally each has only one or two letters to describe them perfectly. Of course you can use compressed complex number with accent to have the actual number in brackets, italic and little bit gray with blue dots *haha*, where both complex number parts 4 and 4, and number of accents - one or two ´’s or one or two ` to fit your 4-based system; this has f (max frequency, number of possible digit values) of 64, thus exceeding even the decimal system despite you would have hard time to read the numbers.

### Three Relations of Infinity - Theorems of Projective Geometry

<aside>
💡

First Theorem of Projective Infinity: Curve and equivalent angle to the whole curve relate zero to infinity, creating unexpressable dimension for classical math.

</aside>

<aside>
💡

Second Theorem of Projective Infinity: Integrating velocity into acceleration, you see values where tangent (relation) is there, but no numbers.

</aside>

<aside>
💡

Third Theorem of Projective Infinity: If your functions go straight up or down, they have unknowns in infinity.

</aside>

While given math is enough to solve this, you find suitable spaces instantly, consider the following:

- Where infinities have no fixed size, they have fixed relations. This means, here you can rotate infinitely upwards - but normal limit infinity would give you any length of this line pointing upwards, even so small that invisible; so, infinities can be however small, which is a theorem of Laegna - properties of infinities, you can find them even inside Zero. If you measure the same infinity, the limit value is always the same - E is the value where circle has zero angle, and just zooming in does not move it. However, it’s more precise, where lower-octave E would be an area, where higher-octave E has more specific point inside it being an infinity, and thus it’s much bigger number if you approach to better infinity; also, as you Zoomed in not only by projection factor, but still finding a digit for each appearing number, so that you rather write your number on several lines (also having “1 degree” difference, in Laegna degrees 1/4 of infinite unit point circle and in square degrees rather than circle degrees, you can add square and d as square itself could be notion for a number type). If you count, on different coordinate systems, to same point in infinity, you get different number of points and thus, much enough taste and it all has more quality.

### Multiplication Theorem of Infinity

<aside>
💡

When Adding, you don’t need to add dimension; when multiplying, for example to make numbers below one not becoming binary counterparts, facing backwards: you raise the exponent level of dimension, for example 8 cm * 8 cm = (8 * 8) cm^2 is trivial, but not the case that numbers without units create measurable infinities - the line length for points in (8 * 8) cm^2, mapping from cm^2 to cm, gives line with infinite length.

</aside>

### Numbers in Turing complex (I call back-refferring number so):

Number has T and R:

- T is it’s face value, the person you would see outside (or perhaps any side to make it perfect).
- R is the real value, which exist in it’s position in complex mathematical context space, including itself as a minor dot (48, numbers 4-8, are not possible if numbers 1-4 would also not be contained; for example consider the limit value theorems which would say that when you change the octave of the same number, in higher octave you have information qualities such as having many more possibilities, thus more energy or force to solve this equation, where you would have been agreed with limited set of possible / potential solutions; in theorem of unrelated infinites you consider this that at least it’s information, even if you are able to measure the actual coordinates and angles only in local infinitum).

You can write number R has projection R’, where normally the projection in Logecs would be equal to the number:

- Number R itself is the actual number.
- Projection R’ is the number as it exists in your logic.
    - You fix this most primitively with trial and error, or by some resulting science or ability of mind, for example to intuitively grasp the theorems around your number, but over time not when you need first solution. You can multiply your number with *loan*, also as it works like stock market: if it’s better in the future, it’s better now, but you have to work hard to have this contained in the R’.

So, for Polar system, where O and A are yeses, but I and E are no’s of a kind, you have these numbers in format N = (#N, #N’)

- I = (A, O). The actual value is A but it seems O.
- O = (O, O). The value is O.
- A = (A, A). The value is A.
- E = (O, A). The actual value is O but it seems A.

This is only one of numerous number mappings enabling the integrity of Logecs between (*Logecs*) Logecs and (*Logecs*) Mathematecs. On numerous axes, which all express the topology of ten (four) completely, you can project the Laegna numbers having number being smaller or bigger than itself in various ways.

What you do with this:

- For I value, you see this rather in absolute; it’s not how you measure numbers, but the machine would see a person in worse light, consequently using it’s resources otherwere, or more deeper even attack. This is the mathematical position where negotion appears that one value is attacking the other, or attacking it’s own value. Use rather T, the automata axe, not R, the meaning - despite that in numeric system, those two are aligned to the same line and have only one axe, so the machine is defined as the goal (life). Seeing a person in worse light than they are, in degree of the mistake you also mistreat them, doing ill, for example lacking a greeting despite you greet such type of people.
- For E value, it’s rather the gold rush, carefully desribed in motive texts here where in long text, big groups go through all transformations of these values - “The Sanity Paradox: A Tale of Power, Reality, and Law”, also the unidentified genius story, those are complex stories in L (society, social groups as logecs values) and R (the individuals) - where you can grasp where Logecs would grasp some complex values in stories like Christ and Socrates, where the binary values would leave you unimpressed of the mistake, rather flegmatic.

In the other number scale (Linear Laegna numbers vs. Polar, where there is symmtric polarity towards both directions), I and O are the O values (False) and A and E are the A values (True, in complex relation indeed not just true):

<aside>
💡

**Laegna Number Philosophy**: Laegna numbers are designed to be read easily by the emotional and general value, where the exact values of digits in given context, where user is almost free to define them, would require reading intros or referred theories and axioms. More generally, you want to know is it good (A, É) or bad (I) number, is it too much (E = È) or not enough (I); you don’t want to know this *after* you pass the technological test, but maybe it’s only your husband who is scientist and you simply want to know what he is doing, looking the numbers and not complex explanations and inner details of how those numbers work. This design follows: while there are numerous transistions you can do with numbers without many calculations or repositionings nor grand changes in values and their structures; a few number formats such as polar and linear can be chosen, as number is almost always circular and cyclic, or linear and unitary, and these two can be expressed in numerous conditions and different axes of Laegna.

</aside>

<aside>
💡

**(Laegna) Lineapolar Number Compability**: while those axes seem very different, È the Polar E is defined as being “too good to be possible”, while É is defined as being “innovative, accelerating, going further with your numbers”, while A fulfills existing qualities in local space, not affecting the structure and direction of coordinate axe beyond rather it’s own position. E is the acceleration, fundamental change in quality of each numer in the axe - in past, the real stock values go up even if it’s not visible in imaginary, projected axe where you can go mad as well so you need to recover with all your philosophy and math; I mean, math-mad, and in future, it will be permanently better for each A or O. The difference between I and E are of size L, whereas the difference of O and A of size R. Initially, this is rather the symbolic or abstract theorem language, but what you need to know - the same number, without changing, would move between polar and linear coordinates depending on your depression factor, where optimist would try rather linear multiplicator, and pessimist would be happy with polar coordinate system. So even if you try to put your number into one or another number system, and explain people that while it’s strictly not impossible, we would not finish tomorrow; they might, suddenly, read it in linear coordinates such as still demanding it for tomorrow, exactly because of what you seed. This is not the mistake in Laegna system, but the Posetive in general.

Psychological factor: conversation people can do between these axes, is almost trivial because of evolutionary factors and the way we must process the future probabilities.

</aside>

### Laegna Theorem of Hope

Okay to be fully spiritual we need some hope:

<aside>
💡

Given that you are rather falling back if you don’t progress, as the time itself must succeed in time and it’s impossibilities do not necessarily hit the past from the future, but we are in slow, accelerating progress, to do it first here and now, but ultimately to measure in ultimate finity, which wants to see better results over time even if breaking that law seemed to be possible; the law would later still appear and you cen foresee it and be a little better. So, where you have an actual Polar vector which is not very hopeful, you will replace it with 99% Polar, 1% Linear components summed, or you even try to contain those as free factors or variables, still visible as separate components, which is easier in Laegna. The factor is that statistical factor of going a little bit upwards works as self-fulfilling prophecy in sense that you don’t get a chance without **Yen** (symbolize it by ¥), the positive expectation. It includes positive expectation about the Sin / **Zin**, the Sinus - you expect to Neglect a little worse, than could happen in the worst case. This is that numbers often become possible because you calculated this, and the value it has as a goal reflects the major coordinate system of the reality so that slight direction upwards would work like a magic and fulfill itself. It’s a mathematical fact, but I don’t want like 45 proofs here in this document :) Rather I want to with you good luck in each formula and equation!

**Zen**: you are still realistic, here-and-now factor being rather 99% and having the exception, which proves the rule. In Laegna, the last perfection for any theorem becomes Posetive, an unrealistic fact, and while you must truly survive if it’s only Polar factor, the hope is not complete giving in, but also within Zen, the being-realistically(matter)-and-psychologically(spirit)-ready-to-let-go; your Zen cannot assume the Black without a little White circle inside, the *now* not containing any past and future at all - rather, the past might exist in the Root chakra (ifrequency), and future in the Chrown (efrequency).

</aside>

Okay, good luck, I think this document is now contained!

Or, one more part like the last song..

### Introspiritual and Extrospiritual view

***Introspiritual - the Force comes from inside.***

Buddhist and Eastern systems, with some exception perhaps to Confucionism (which is still quite east in general); Bottom-Up Truth and Power:

- The force comes from inside, and we must perfect our being. In this situation, for example instead of punishing the criminal, they would need to heal themselves, as they could not get good karma from outside force well; this is one-sided view to east.
- The society, it’s global illumination comes from enlightened souls inspiring each others, rather one is inspiring one and it has a chain reaction; there will be the karmic cyrcles, which accumulate into social effects. Notice relying only on this can be unreasonably large effort for the whole society, Earth or it’s expansion the potential star friends.
- **Superpower**: karma forms positive effects, from zero to power to, indeed, some superpower such as miracle or good work; for introspiritual practices, you get this personally, so you are the enlightened person.
- **Karmic effect**: personal Truth and Power achieved.
- **Miracles**: this is rather personal, such as healing with inner force or helping a friend in need; it could be sudden moment in nature. As you go on with stories, you can speculate about many miracles, and perhaps go through situations yourself which would enlighten your mind or feel vitally alive and uncommon, up to breaking some still-there little boxes made of short-term implications of physical laws and psychological archetypal stories. Mostly, enlightenment - coming to full consciousness - and mindfulness or feelings of harmony and love are considered miracles each time you are shifting towards purer forms. In Laegna language, I use the word “spectacle” for a miracle, because indeed I believe more in National Geographic with it’s miraculous views of nature and miraculous moments of life, rather than Harry Potter where I cannot understand, how the miracles are done, and where they look just plain stupid.

***Extraspiritual - the Force is out there.***

Christian and Western systems, such as ethical, political and social views outgrown from applied scientific views, which might also involve western atheism; Top-Down Truth and Power:

- The force comes from cultural effort and also, from outer enforcement. Intellectual (vs. Intelligent as in introspiritual realm) would learn a small, specialized area and discuss it in efficient manner, and the science appear far above them on it’s own. Here, while a criminal, once stopped, would have not made good karma or shown any brilliance on it’s own, the people saved would definitely benefit from good karma, but the real argument comes..
- The person, their personal illumination comes from access to libraries, education and (a little influenced by east) lifetime growth programs. Still, noticeably within singularity of such systems the “gray mass” appears, to be criticized - people, who rather look the same and think the same. Often, they have read the same schoolbook and not got much personal education.
- **Superpower**: not the nation nor the politician gets it personally, for it’s the circular effect of collective karma. The superpowers appear, mythologically containing both aliens and miracles, such as aliens and miracles in introspiritual mythos would be; but appearing rather as collective effects, such as Men in Black would be famous cinema example - comparative to rather introspiritual cinema examples such as Matrix, based on rather modern Buddhist story. The karmic energy comes mostly from circular effects of energetic amplifications, and the energy-efficiency exists in many areas such as civilized efforts, business climate and open science or GPL licences and free software; but also in police-controlled crimes and recovering criminals, which would add energy from the lowest, and forcefully (unlike conventional western Buddhist). The force feedback mechanism with second proof of karma would remind, that while Buddhist karma provides direct amplification to his actions, the Christian karma rather comes from grand complexes of human life, and is fed back to them - a little person, part of gray mass, rarely aware of this. Imaginary unit is creating the karma, and thus benefitting.
- **Karmic effect**: karma acquired by social structures, collectives and oscillations of images of civilization (such as flags, anthems and it’s official structures - men in black is good example about how enlightened force would hire people and look rather like officials).
- **Miracles**: in addition to miracle childs, miracles happen such as business miracles, political miracles for example human rights etc. Instead of each short story having good end as in pre-historic forms of Shamanism, rather the basis is generalized and done undone (Tao), so that each story in general framework does not even reach the problems of fairy tales easily, and they definitely win in front of the well-understood laws or the (actual, at given time, which might be measured generations later) third world countries.

***Ambispiritual - the Force is karmic circulation.***

Ambispiritual is integrating the two - a Buddhist who, in long life, will read the Teachings of Confucius, or a Christian Collective suddenly starting to “scientifically study” the East and the Buddhism:

- Buddhists, in general, started to learn the atheist science enlightenment, finding many parallels such as Buddha Meditating in Neutral Stance. They might welcome ideas like Zion, to adapt the spiritual parts of “Christianity” (Judeo-Christian-Islamic “trinity” [neutrally, the logical concept appearing in Christianity in this text, where I use it second time - simple logical concept is “three paradigms to the same concept”] is indeed completely authority-controlled force, so you can use any of them; abrahamic religions definitely apply some same ideas, truly coming from authority of God or Objective Reality; and their ideas persist in the scientifications of the nations); perhaps Buddhist would see close truth in Matrix.
- Christians and Atheists, at some point of time, started to collect ideas from the east, specifically from Buddhist and other sources, and rejuvelate them with science; waves after waves, with breaks, the freedom of Buddhist mind becomes popular to enrich the western culture with more personal participiation and energy of creating. We can see their collective superpowers also recognize the kind of eastern enlightened mind.
- **Superpower**: people, who are personally “god-like”, would exist in society, where “real God exists” (the collective union or shared Truth or Superpower, in this atheist degree, or in religious forms, the following of God with no reason - against which I argued in Laegna, but once your visions of God are realistic in terms of your science to understand the will of God based on scientific properties of unions, synchronizations and collective integrals).
- **Karmic Effect**: as the Yang of God outside is aligned with the Yin of God inside; the energy has started from the root and rised to the chrown in a buddhist metaphor, it’s illuminated from frequency I to E - both Sangha (Buddhist family) and Illuminati or Cabal or another form of “good” secret society (More Collective family) appears out of the common actions of the people, where each relation gets the karmic cycle to become enforced; while you do not upgrade your science to reflect a little more complex combinations and possibilities, you talk of miracles.
- **Miracles**: they must be multifaceted, where your personal miracle - a good flow of a day, a love and truth story on personal or rather collective level - is aligned with the equally miraculous flow of the force of such united society; where having each frequency instead of some extreme polarity would enrichen you.

Indeed, mathematically you analyze: if you develop a situation using global and local matrix in simulation of simplified society or rather it’s number correlations of natural decision and natural selection with given hypothesis, then what happens measuring the people who integrate the global, unified matrix with it’s local forms? The global matrix, if you don’t believe God even indirectly (nor “Civilization” of Sid Meyer’s, where the effect of non-local governance would be explained by years passing on clock each time you turn), could be replaced by hologram of local matrices - each person has one copy of global matrix made with local information, and they are parts of the hologram, where the global matrix would be visible in long-term effects of their interaction; but for simulation’s purposes, you would replace this easily with global matrix not being interested in details where you check the formula itself. You are really interested about if only one of the matrices in intelligent, or both two - are they averaged (with limited time and half amount of effort for both), summed (if it’s simply work) or rather multiplied or both adding other exponent factors (which is integral solution, the case which rather happens in reality and Tao - you do them without doing by that you create an integral flow, where both are done and you cannot actually point, when you are doing which or what you are specifically doing beyond your integral nature, which might be working and being social and with intense attention, all at the same time in their age of 50’s or the beginner’s-luck period of Childhood where problems magically disappear).
